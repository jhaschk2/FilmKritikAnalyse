Yes, it is a cardboard copy of A New Hope, as many of the elements do hit the same. But it manages to balance this familiarity with new faces that are acted to perfection, (Relatively) new worlds to explore, and in general a rich new trilogy to indulge with. (For now at least)"

Especially when considering that George lucas wrote a better story for the sequels they CHOOSE not to use\n\nWhen a movie is based on nostalgia it's easier for fans to like it , rather than a movie that tries something.\n\nThis movie was made without passion or love for the saga."

While there are many moments that blatantly copy A New Hope, and the Handling of Han Solo questionable at best, the film manages to restore faith in the Star Wars universe after the release of the uneven prequel trilogy that came before it.

   "review": "I give this movie 3/5 stars for its entertainment value, its homage to the Star Wars legacy, and its potential for future stories. It is a fun and exciting film that captures the spirit and charm of the original trilogy. However, I also think that some aspects of the film are disappointing, such as the lack of originality, the underdeveloped characters, and the unresolved mysteries. The film also suffers from some plot holes and inconsistencies that were later explained or ignored by the subsequent films. The film also fails to live up to the expectations and hype that surrounded it. Nevertheless, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a decent addition to the Star Wars franchise and a good introduction to a new generation of fans."

I understand some people like these new movies, but not 85% of sw fandom. The original didn't make these movies or intended to make them, nor did the original's apprentice. All three are well funded fan films with \"subverted expectation\" dilemmas in story development.

Some characters are retained to give continuity, but they inexplicably behave like morons. It's like having someone who has no understanding of Star Wars write a sequel, so the only thing he can do is a bad imitation. The result is It's like \"A New Hope\" but bought on a scam online shop, with a shining finish but empty inside."

 },
 {
   "review": "The Force Awakens isn't bad, but it isn't good. The story brings nothing new to the universe, and actually almost exactly replicates the plot of A New Hope but with more special effects and over the top stakes. The actors and special effects folks did a fantastic job, however the plot, writing, and creativity leaves an immense amount to be desired. As a die hard star wars fan, this movie is a disservice to the franchise."
 },
 {
   "review": "The Force Awakens is a decent entry point to a new series. Firstly, the VFX, sound design, score and 'secondary' features of a good movie are very well done. The characters are more or less unique and flavoursome in their own right, particularly Finn, a deserter stormtrooper with an exciting arc set up for him. These characters are backed by good performances - actors are clearly passionate about being in Star Wars and do their best when the script challenges them.\nHowever, the main feature of any movie, the story, is disappointingly weak. Despite some very interesting setups which leave you hanging on for more by the end, it requires investment into the next installments which may (or may not...) satisfy.\nIt's essentially a retelling of A New Hope, but arguably deals with these same story beats worse. This also means it does not take risks, something that The Last Jedi takes in the extreme opposite direction. It drip feeds interesting plot points and ideas but does not deliver by the end, leaving viewers wanting for the sequel. This could be seen as a good or bad thing...Although with the benefit of hindsight I would say these setups do not deliver, sullying a lot of the experience of The Force Awakens for viewers coming back after the conclusion of the sequel trilogy. \nThe basic but timeless story however is why it is so rewatchable and digestible, held together by good action and performances. \nThis film is decent as a Star Wars sequel, and middling as a standalone movie. 3/5."

   "review": "Not Star Wars. Not even good enough to qualify it as a cringe fanfiction legend."
 },
 {
   "review": "The Force Awakens marks the first Star Wars film produced after the franchise's acquisition by Disney, and it served as a highly anticipated return to the galaxy far, far away. The film's director, J.J. Abrams, had big shoes to fill, and overall, he did a commendable job of bringing the Star Wars universe back to life.\n\nOne of the most positive aspects of The Force Awakens was its cast. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac all gave compelling performances as new characters Rey, Finn, and Poe, respectively. Harrison Ford's reprisal of Han Solo was also a highlight, bringing a welcome dose of nostalgia to the film. The chemistry between the actors was believable and helped to drive the story forward.\n\nThe film's cinematography was also impressive, with lush landscapes and detailed spacecraft designs. The action scenes were well-choreographed and visually stunning, making for an exciting viewing experience. Additionally, the film's use of practical effects over CGI was a welcome return to the techniques used in the original trilogy.\n\nHowever, one criticism of the film is that its plot felt overly familiar, following a similar structure to the original Star Wars film. The villain, Kylo Ren, felt like a copy of Darth Vader, with a similar costume design and an obsession with the dark side. The film's reliance on nostalgia also made it feel at times like a retread of previous films rather than a fresh take on the Star Wars universe.\n\nAnother issue with The Force Awakens was its pacing. The film had a lot of ground to cover in introducing new characters and setting up a new story, and at times it felt rushed. This made it difficult to fully invest in the story and the characters.\n\nOverall, Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens is an enjoyable addition to the Star Wars franchise. While it may not have taken many risks in terms of its plot and character development, it still provided a thrilling action-packed adventure with a great cast and impressive visuals."

 {
   "review": "Meh its just OK.  Would have been great but they had to do another death star scenario.   Twice was enough.   Three times gets a bit ridiculous don't you think.   The worse part is that it was a foreshadowing of the awful writing and ideas the next two movies would do.   It just gets worse from here. \n\nHoping someday Disney fails, and someone buys Star Wars from the wreckage.  Then they can throw out these garbage movies from canon and take the the universe forward in a more sane and realistic fashion.   Star Wars isn't supposed to be like a marvel comic movie.   But of idiots."

Finn having an arc of turning to the side of good and getting over his time with the first order is a unique arc for a star wars character and Rey having an arc about wanting her family to return and yearning to belong, goes great with that.
