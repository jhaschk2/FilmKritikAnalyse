"J. J. Abrams delivers yet another rebooted spectacle that trades on troupes, allusions and enough hype to distract viewers from the quintessential fact that this is just ""A New Hope"" furnished with new special effects."
"Seriously cannot create a sequel without copying the originals? Should have made your own storylines"
"Viewed on it's own it showed some promise. However, it's really a remake of the first 2 movies."
"So much potential. Last good mainline star wars movie. The only sequel movie I can watch and have any enjoyment."
"A good attempt of a copy and paste"
"Another cash-grab from Disney. This was literally ""A New Hope"" No original ideas were made. Though bringing back beloved characters, was nostalgic, it was also very lazy. The VFX and nostalgia are the only reason this movie did good."
"I mean it's alright for what it's worth, but it feels like the plot's been done before and there are so many plot holes"
"A sort of retelling of the first Star Wars with lots of special effects… did we really need this?"
"I'm sorry but aside from it being a copy and paste from Episode 4, people need to wake up and see that this is unoriginal and seriously?!!… Rey?…. She's an OP character that has no character build. Finn is god obsessed with Rey and it's cringe. The story could've been better. The only great sequence of this was when Death Star #2 destroys the 5 planets. That's all."
"The worst part of this film is how it's a near beat for beat remake of Episode 4, yet no one seems to notice nor care. At least Finn is something new and not a discount version of better characters with a neat concept. John Boyega is the primary reason this film gets 1 star instead of half a Star."
"This is the film that reignited my love of Star Wars. Since I was a child I've loved the Star Wars universe, I'm a product of the Prequel era I grew up and became an adult between trilogies. So for this to be the films Star Wars film to see in the cinema as an adult it was a truly magical experience."
"The Force Awakens manages to balance recognizable ingredients from the Star Wars recipe with more modern flavors fairly well. The biggest flaws are all the convenient coincidences and the recycled plot elements. Rey as a protagonist doesn't really work that good either."
"Copy/Paste from A New Hope, but still a lot of fun."
"Literally just a complete remake of A New Hope. Absolutely awful with no creativity what so ever"
"2 stars for the visual. For the rest a copy of ""a new hope"".
A very bad message, while education was in the hart of the first trilogy (4-6). Here is the reality show version. You can be famous without doing anything. No effort is really necessary to become a Jedi or an adult.  Kill your parents, it's their fault if you don't succeed to be good not yours."
"A remake of episode 4  Ray won the first lightsaber battle after only holding the saber for the first time destroys kylo. She should have lost this battle especially since she learns off of luke in the next film. She should have lost and it would have given these films some stakes and would have gotten the audience right behind her to win the next battle. I wish one day some other company get hold of star wars and remake this movie properly."
"This movie was just a new hope but with better CGI and worse acting, this movie is nothing special and took away han solos entire character for no good reason."
"The Force Awakens is more of a reboot than a sequel, closely following the structure of the original 1977 Star Wars film, A New Hope. However, while it may lack originality, it compensates with practical effects, improved combat sequences, and modern CGI. Overall, The Force Awakens stands as a commendable film that should have paved the way for a fantastic trilogy."
"There were some things I liked but overall, the writers room failed hard on this one."
"I tried to like it. I watched it 3 times in the theater. I tried to convince myself it was good. Upon much reflection and watching it in conjunction with the disasters that came after, it should have been much better. It doesn't take much of a Star Wars fan to know that this didn't serve anyone. The OT was written badly, but it was earnest in its storytelling and mythos. This was just trite with acting that fell short of what you thought it should be. 

The worst part is the story. I liked Rey, but her powers were ridiculous. The trailer leading into the story made you think there was going to be more than Rey. The story that was hinted at... Finn feeling the force and becoming a Jedi after being a stormtrooper was the story that would have been interesting. Of course, after this movie, any hope of a rebirth of Star Wars was completely destroyed by Rian Johnson in The Last Jedi."
"And so the mighty Star Wars franchise came back with belated sequel Episode VII led by a new studio and a new director. J.J. Abrams took on the huge project, jumping head first into the ever-tedious challenge of pleasing both die hard fans of the classics and a brand new generation of potential Star Warsians.

The Force Awakens takes place 30 years after Return Of The Jedi and, while it does prioritize the introduction of fresh characters, it also checks in with some familiar faces. Harrison Ford is back as cocky smuggler Han Solo and so is his furry companion Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), both showing up about half an hour into the movie and bringing with them some welcome nostalgia.

Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), now General Leia Organa, also returns in a smaller capacity and we get a fleeting glimpse at Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Of course, droid favorites C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) are also present because, let's face it, would it really be a Star Wars movie without them?The immortal text crawl informs us that Luke Skywalker has vanished and The Empire has given birth to The First Order, a new(-ish) totalitarian regime.

Believe it or not, said regime is also predominantly run by pedantic Cambridge graduates in silly costumes along with an intimidating Darth Vader-style badass, and there's also a Death Star. Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is given a map to Skywalker by an old friend and, before he is detained by masked baddie Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), he hides it inside adorable droid BB-8 who then wanders desert planet Jakku aimlessly. Eventually, he meets loner scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) who protects him. Meanwhile, stormtrooper FN-2187 (aka Finn) realizes he shouldn't be part of the cruel First Order and escapes with Poe's help. They crash land on Jakku and that's how Finn (John Boyega) meets Rey and the adventure truly begins.

The new characters' individual stories are definitely strong enough to hold this movie together and the characters themselves are certainly more likable than I, for one, ever expected them to be. Other additions like BB-8 and possible Yoda replacement Maz Kanata (voiced by Lupita Nyong'o) are promising also, though Emperor-style villain Supreme Leader Snoke (voiced by Andy Serkis), a ghoulish CGI fellow, doesn't get a chance to impress. J.J. Abrams tells those mini stories really well but we feel, throughout, that there's a lot we're purposely not being told, key elements that will probably only be revealed in upcoming prequels and sequels.

The bigger story is Star Wars on auto-pilot: this whole Death Star-Resistance-First Order business is a scenario we've seen time and time again and this movie offers nothing all that new there.In fact, I would argue that this is The Force Awakens' main problem. When aiming for nostalgia or familiarity, it tends to instead hit a tired been-there-done-that kind of feel. The parallels with A New Hope have been mentioned by quite a few reviewers and it's true that there's a bit too much of that to the point where one wonders, a little like with Avatar, how this movie was 10 years in the making. Should Disney have taken on George Lucas' all-new ideas after all? Who knows.

The tone of the film is also unclear as it attempts to be both bright and hopeful but quite dark and depressing as well. Rey and Finn are introduced to us as troubled loners and yet they're cracking jokes pretty quick, the humour taking you out of the movie more than anything else.The main subplot, which involves Kylo Ren and his father, builds to a big event near the end of the movie and that should either please fans or annoy them royally. Whether this final clash was truly earned will depend on its overall impact on the trilogy, but if the aim was to shock then mission accomplished.

Adam Driver does a good job as Ren, I should point out, and it's refreshing to see that we are not just fed a Darth Vader clone. That said, had the First Order been a more valid, interesting threat altogether, with a more interesting plan, that would have helped make Ren more threatening than he is. The film ends in a promising way and it really does make you want to watch what comes next.The Force Awakens is an enjoyable, if flawed, entry into the franchise.

The film lacks the originality and urgency of the prequels, as well as the freshness and epic scale of the originals. Some things it does right, other things not so much: it's a very hit-and-miss affair but, as a whole, it remains an entertaining blockbuster that's worth a watch.

Chewie, we're home... kinda."
"There could have been a littler better in the story ling in the movie but great story to a great franchies"
"This Movie is very Uninventive, even with the Nostalgic characters from the Original Trilogy, and even with familiar faces, this is more of a cash grab than a good storytelling movie, the Writing is bad & cheesy, the lightsaber fights are very dull and underwhelming, and the Disney Princess Shtick was actually very bad, there are a few good things about this film, I like the characters of Finn and Poe Dameron those guys were pretty entertaining and funny, and the performances of Captain Phasma and Domhnall Gleeson were very enjoyable, but this movie is just frustratingly predictable, even if Han Solos murder was pretty shocking to some, I was actually upset in a frustrating way... almost everything about this movie is bland and boring, and the visual effects were uninventive and makes the Prequel Trilogy's visual effects look like the 1970s classics"
"Especially after the next two films one realizes this was a pretty damn good movie."
"Rating: 8/10. 85/100"
"Assisti três vezes, um filme excelente, recomendo a todos, fiquei muito satisfeito!"
"Recycled but acceptable.  To bad it's not more than what I'd expected."
"Just a episode 4 reboot with new characters. no creativity, no Character growth"
"A very fun movie that basically repeats another movie from the same franchise, safe bet, but it can feel frustrating to see te resemblance."
"The Force Awakens is a disappointing film that offers nothing new to the Star Wars franchise. In fact, it simply signals the end of what Star Wars was and the start of something else that is not Star Wars. It is a rehash of old plot lines and characters, with a protagonist who undergoes no meaningful character arc.

The film is visually stunning, with some truly breathtaking special effects. However, the story is unoriginal, predictable and clearly copying previous events in Star Wars. The plot is essentially a retread of the original Star Wars film, with Rey filling the role of Luke Skywalker and Kylo Ren filling the role of Darth Vader. It is essentially nothing new, with a character that does not grow like Luke does. 

Rey is also a very bland and uninteresting protagonist. She is immediately good at everything she does, and she undergoes no real character development over the course of the film. 

Overall, The Force Awakens is a disappointing film that offers nothing new to the Star Wars franchise. It is a rehash of old plot lines and characters, with a protagonist who undergoes no meaningful character arc."
"Great movie, I really liked it."
"As a die-hard Star Wars fan myself, I found this film to be Disney's utmost disappointment. Obviously sets up a terrible trilogy, and is a copy-paste of the worst parts of A New Hope. While the visuals are stellar and characters alright, everything else is just classically Disney Star Wars."
"I was expecting to see a continuation/expansion/evolution of Star Wars, not re-make of ""A New Hope"" with a Mary Sue and no on-screen combo of Leia, Luke, and Han. And then killing off a legendary and beloved character in such a pathetic, meaningless way....that just shows ignorance of and disrespect for the story, canon, material, and fans.

"Best of the sequels, I really liked this movie, and it's what got me into Star Wars."
"A great start to a trilogy, it's a shame how it ended up becoming."
"At first we felt it was promising. In hindsight not so much."
"My initial feelings watching it in 2015 would've rendered this rating a (still generous) half star. Its extra star comes from its impressive visuals and its action scenes are also something to be credited for. Now the very long list of cons. The villains are as unimaginative as they are two-dimensional and bland. The good guys also suffer from this, as well as a plethora of new, equally boring protagonists whose role in the film merely was a forgettable spectacle. The plot is a bloated, flashy, flawed clone copy of Episode IV, and you need not even look past the parentless soon-to-become Padawan raised on a dune planet with a knack for flying and droids to see that. Except this time, there's no Jedi mentor! Combine this with a constant intuitive need to fill in a lot of gaps in context, for a story that was far better told almost 40 years prior, and I'm afraid giving this film more than 3/10 seems awfully generous."
"Opposed to the next two movies in the future it was fun."
"It wasn't bad.  I'd still recommend it as a standalone movie, but it did underwhelm when I first saw it on opening night.  Rewatching it again after a few years and I don't think my feelings have changed - it was Disney playing it safe with the IP and practically recreating A New Hope beat for beat.  5/10.  There's much better Star Wars media out there to consume, but there's also significantly worse."
"Sadly killing off our beloved hero's is just a stab in the heart to true fans. Another unreal score as I've seen no one who puts this anywhere near the first three original movies"
"They had so much potential to make Finn the next Jedi. It would be so cool to see a black former stormtrooper become a hero."
"The best one out of the 3, unfortunately they wasted such a great character like finn. He needed to be the jedi tbf or both rey and finn."
"The best Star Wars film of all time"
"J.J. Abrams actually had a reasonably simple job here, pander to the fans, reintroduce the old characters, establish new characters, introduce new (well, honestly repackaged old) conflicts, but provide very little payoff or justification for any of it. The new characters are exciting (if a little vaguely drawn) and the movie is undeniably entertaining but again, this isn't really something that can stand on its own."
"es una copia literal del episodio IV, un personaje del desierto que perdió todo conoce a un androide con una información importante para los rebeldes, o en este caso los mediocres de la república que tenían menos recursos que los rebeldes de antaño, luego es sobre una arma masiva, con un punto débil super tonto, en la estrella de la muerte se entiende, pues se justifica con el arquitecto y los sucesos de Rouge One, e incluso explican que la segunda estrella ya no va a tener ese punto débil. Aquí es que de verdad la primera orden son payasos mediocres sin propósito y sin inteligencia. La muerte de Han es totalmente absurda e incompetente, en primera es un punto débil y no está ni siquiera bien resguardada, pésima película de inicio al final."
"Did I seriously need to watch a film that felt like a cheap recreation of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope?"
"Parece que em vez de criar uma narrativa original, os produtores optaram pelo caminho seguro, repetindo o mesmo enredo que já vimos antes. Foi um desapontamento."
"Pior filme da saga star Wars, espero que melhorem nas próximas trilogias e filmes."
"From an execution stand point, the performances and visuals were amazing.

From a story and continuity stand point, one of the most disappointing sci-fi films I have seen. The fact that it had the Star Wars title was just embarrassing."
"It's just a shameless rip-off of the original Star Wars movie, right down to the climactic destruction of another Death Star. Rey is Luke. Kylo Ren is Darth Vader. BB-8 is R2-D2. BB-8 is pursued by the Empire for having a map of Luke's home, while R2-D2 had the Death Star plans. Instead of Luke watching Vader kill Obi-Wan, Rey watches Ren kill Han Solo. And then there are the ludicrous aspects, like Rey inexplicably knowing how to use the Jedi mind trick on a Stormtrooper, or being able to wield a lightsaber as expertly as Ren, despite never before having even held one. It's a mostly competently made rip-off, but it's still a rip-off, like almost everything J.J. Abrams has ever done."
"This movie was not terrible. It had me excited for the future of the star wars franchise (I did not know what the future would hold...). The movie was solid, and did a decent job of setting up the characters for something interesting. The major critique with this movie is that it was pretty much a copy/paste of A New Hope; so it played it too safe with the plot and characters, to the point where it was too much."
"It's the kind of film that sets the stage for an epic adventure, but ultimately fails to deliver in the end. As a stand alone, I would give this a solid 3.5 stars. It entertains. It generates questions. It leads in a coherent direction, but the subsequent films ruin all the potential. The actors were strong in this one. The mood and music were authentically Star Wars. It ""felt"" like we were about to get a quality story, but, as we all know, that did not happen. Nevertheless, I can watch this film without wanting to break my TV."
"THIS MOVIE IS GREAT!!"
"Had great promise, even though Rey is a Mary Sue and snope was a dead herring it had a great energy, excitement, and there was hope that Star Wars thrive.  Pity the sequels after this, sucked so badly."
"Nice try to makes something new but it backfired and created a trilogy of chaos that hopefully gets deleted from canon"
"A sequel that does a good job at bringing together new and old characters, but not a great job at setting up a story unique from the Star Wars we've already seen."
"I had to come to terms with this and be real with what I witnessed.  A lot of good-looking scenes but a waste of the OG 3.  A lot of rehashing which isn't bad but isn't great either.  The best out of the sequel so-called trilogy."
"Basically an inferior retelling of the original Star Wars (that was it's name then). Nothing new at all. I had hopes even after the prequels but was actually quite disappointed."
"The director himself, J.J. Abrams, said that if you like the film, you need to have your sanity checked."
"The first half hour to hour has some promising character building but it ultimately fails to deliver anything but merchandising opportunities."
"Para mim o ep VII é uma cópia do ep IV."
"Star Wars: Force Awakens is a terrible reboot that we did not ask for nor need. The characters and casting are terrible, the way they brought back our favorite characters back from the original trilogy was horrendous, etc. Rey is just such a bad character."
"""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is a thrilling return to the beloved galaxy we all know and love. As a lifelong fan of the franchise, I couldn't help but be captivated by the nostalgia and excitement that this film brought to the screen. The film masterfully blends the old with the new, introducing a new generation of characters while paying homage to the iconic ones we've cherished for decades. Daisy Ridley's Rey and John Boyega's Finn shine as charismatic leads, and their chemistry is undeniable. Adam Driver's Kylo Ren adds a compelling layer of complexity to the villainous role, making him more than just a one-dimensional bad guy. The action sequences are nothing short of spectacular, with breathtaking visual effects that bring the battles to life in a way only Star Wars can. The lightsaber duels are particularly thrilling, and the space battles are a feast for the eyes. While ""The Force Awakens"" hits many of the right notes, it also leaves some questions unanswered, which may leave die-hard fans wanting more. Additionally, it sticks closely to the formula of the original trilogy, which, while nostalgic, may feel somewhat safe to some viewers."
"Good but the laat trilogy is less"
"Good action and a charming cast. But the plot is painfully unoriginal and it is overall a wasted opportunity. Han Solo's end was extremely unemotional, Kylo Ren is a bit of a turd, Rey's lines are annoying and the world building is non-existant. Bit lazy there Disney!"
"Film plaisant à regarder 
Mais malheureusement n'est qu'un calque de l'épisode IV…et en moins bien en plus 
Et puis Luke a disparu ? S'ils avaient fouillé la carcasse de celui ci il aurait été retrouvé depuis le début
Bref l'histoire ne colle pas"
"I'm not that old, but I think I can safely say this was probably the most anticipated film of all time. If you're coming to get some original trilogy nostalgia, while still getting an entertaining and intriguing movie, you'll get what you came for. Unfortunately, the very nature of the plot in The Force Awakens has the movie leaning heavily on future installments, and we all know how that went. This takes away a lot of the value in rewatchability, and now the movie stands as a monument of what could have been."
"This had potential, I understand the high scores given that its the return of Star Wars and continuing the Skywalker Saga. Thats a big chunk as to why it did so well at the box office. Other then that, it left maybe some wiggle room for the other films to make it good. Now that we have a bigger view of whats going on. Terrible movie. Disney tried to make something outside of George Lucas's vision and failed miserably. This is not Star Wars. This is a bastardization of what Star Wars was. Will not be sharing this with my children."
"We should had two great sequels from this film we will never see, hyped up and really  felt like a return but Trilogy just to end up DEAD franchise. Shame"
"If this were not a blatant plagiarism of A New Hope, The Force Awakens would be a great movie. Instead, it plays as its predecessor with updated faces and effects."
"Definitely thought it was a solid return for Star Wars, but this doesn't even come close to the original trilogy."
"Amazing! Too bad the follow ups aren't tho"
"It was ok the ending was so stupid had a whole bunch of plot holes like was finn sanitation yet fighting on that raid why does he act like hes from earth how can rey with no training take on a skywalker also Kylo ren and finn should both be dead since a lightsaber litterally went right through them what a wast of good actors"
"One of the best films in the Star Wars saga, which honors all the great legacy of the franchise. Incredible script and direction."
"A legendary saga returns! Ever since RETURN OF THE JEDI, many people have waited to see a brand new story come alive in a galaxy far, far away, and I have some fantastic news: we've got one, and it's an absolute blast! STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS brings back familiar favorites and brings back the classic sci-fi action and excitement in full force, while bringing lots of fantastic new characters into the fight."
"Good movie, the best of the sequels. Loved the introduction of the first order and loved Finn. 5.1/10"
"Disney doesn't understand cinema anymore."
"It's good, but I think the reason for that is it's basically A New Hope. Watch A New Hope and The Force Awakens directly afterwards and I think you'll understand what I'm talking about."
"Not going to lie, I fell asleep more than once."
"Another great addition to the Skywalker saga, you can only wish the other two sequels were as good as this one."
"I really enjoyed the movie but it almost seemed to parallel the original in too many ways."
"This movie was enjoyable but it was very safe for a Star Wars movie. I liked it, but it could have been so much more. It just feels like a modern repeat of a New Hope, but not a good."
"The Force Awakens cleverly blends nostalgia with fresh elements, introducing a new generation of characters and reigniting the spirit of the original trilogy, resulting in an exciting and visually stunning entry that captivates audiences old and new."
"if i could give this movie a one, i would. this movie is so horrible i was yawning and get mad the whole time. this character named kylo ren is absolutely horrible and annoying to even look at, made the movie 100x worse and barks at the others 24/7. i felt like i was watching secret life of pets instead of star wars 7. DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE IF UR LOOKING FOR SOMETHING GOOD TO WATCH BECAUSE THIS IS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE. KYLO NEEDS TO BE HUMBLED AND OFF THE SCREEN ( preferably with a belt ). i don't recommend at all."
"It was fine by far best of the trilogy"
"I'm not going to let hind sight change my rating, this is an enjoyable movie.  It does play it safe with the story but is executed well.  It's more difficult to recommend now because of how disappointing it's sequels were but if you haven't seen this yet and want an enjoyable action/adventure movie, this is a good time."
"This isn't a must watch. I enjoyed it but I understand why people wouldn't. I remember joking about how much like A New Hope this film is when it released but WOW it really did copy the trench run and then the bit from Return of the Jedi where Lando flies into the Death Star"
"Star Wars 7 non aggiunge nulla alla saga, ma è comunque un buon film per divertirsi"
"This was the start of something great.  JJ Abrams did a wonderful job creating a new and original film while paying homage to the prequels and at the same time laying bread crumbs and twists for future episodes 8 and 9.   You can honestly tell Abrams had creative control and this movie wasn't tarnished by the mouse of mouse.  The classic Star Wars humor in this movie was there, along with the usual space adventure stuff and unfortunately this movie was the highlight of the new trilogy.   This trilogy felt rushed and unfinished after episode 7.  Something I really do not like are the lightsaber duels in the new trilogy.  All the lightsaber duels melt the colors together and it looks like a video game… the reflections and red + blue sabers= purple just looks corny. Not much else to say… it's a bummer to think what could have been…"
"And Star Wars is back in action! Although not the best, this film is definitely past the halfway point of my favorite Star Wars movies. Trust me, that's an accomplishment. Harrison Ford, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Adam Driver all did exceptional, and the storyline was great! Overall, a great film"
"Fantastic directing, excellent actors, and it has the magic  that can be compared with the Original Trilogy. The story copies too much from Episode 4 but it's a very well executed movie. It's such a shame Episode 8 and 9 are not on par with Episode 7."
"Action was great. So was Rey, for the first half an hour or so. Forgettable characters, forgettable plot, the first shot in the foot of a whole magazine of shitty disney flicks."
"The beginning of the end of star wars."
"After ""Waiting for Godot""... ""Waiting for Luke""."
"I originally really liked this movie. Sure it copied some things from previous Star Wars movies and I get the complaints people had with it, but it had a lot of original stuff too and took new characters in interesting new directions (mainly Rey and Kylo, although in my view Daisy Ridley is a great actress and Adam Driver isn't, very expressionless and stale). This movie made me have high hopes for the new triology...and then the Last Jedi came out (ugh)...and then Rise of Skywalker (UGH).

This movie would've remained good/better if it led to something better, but unfortunately it did not and that's why I can no longer like it as much... if I watch this movie again I just know it's leading to two movies that are absolute atrocities to the Star Wars franchise. I give it credit for being good for quite a few things when it came out and was good fun, but unfortunately the Disney Sequel trilogy is too irredeemable for me at this point. It's quite sad really..."
"An absolute insult to star wars."
"It is a very generic star wars movie because of the fact that it's just a new hope with ray inread of luke."
"A poor rehash of a great film."
"It’s like a there was a well written script and they said “nah let’s do the opposite!”"
"I’m an Original Trilogy guy and I loved it. I’m so happy to have more Star Wars movies. Harrison Ford as Han Solo, I mean what else can you ask for? The scene where Han & Chewie are in the Millennium Falcon and Han says “Chewie we’re Home” I cried like a little kid."
"A very very well made remake of a new hope Nothing more, nothing less. I was hoping to see some brand new ground being covered after the epic final moments of the return of the Jedi, but no we get a complete re tread. It was a good movie but I wanted something new. It didn't even reunite all of our original hero's together which is very sad."
"Bad… very very bad! I feel bad for the kids who have to grow up with this as their Star Wars 😢"
"Disappointing very very disappointing"
"This was my first introduction into the star wars universe and it still holds up pretty well. While yes it's true that it was basically the original trilogy again even bringing back the original cast it was still different enough. honestly a great watch and would recommend but it still is a new hope and the empire strikes back."
"Not necessary for the plot, bad light Saber effects, repeat of episode 4 and 6"
"Oh, woe betide the state of my beloved franchise! Alas, what have they done to Star Wars? The force that once burned brightly within its heart hath dimmed, leaving a void of disappointment and dismay. The essence that made it a beacon of cinematic excellence hath been forsaken. The cherished characters and the grandeur of its universe have been cast aside, leaving naught but a hollow shell of what once was. Verily, my heart doth mourn the loss of this once-majestic saga, for it hath lost its way, relinquishing the force that bound it together. Mayhap, in time, it shall find redemption and rekindle the flame of its former glory."
"No Darth Vader so don't watch"
"I really liked this movie.
I get it's a lot like A New Hope but after the chaotic mess the prequels were at times, it's good to come back to something that resembled the Star Wars universe we fell in love with.
Diversity in casting & characters is a welcome change as well."
"I can see why TLJ lacked character development."
"Best of the sequels and I still rate it this low. Sequels were trash"
"Um filme pssimo, com um elenco ruim e um roteiro terrvel."
"6/10
""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" foi um filme muito aguardado pelos fãs da franquia, prometendo trazer de volta a magia e o encanto dos filmes originais. No entanto, o resultado final deixou a desejar, revelando-se uma experiência frustrante repleta de promessas vazias.

Um dos pontos negativos do filme é a falta de originalidade em sua trama. ""The Force Awakens"" opta por seguir uma estrutura narrativa muito similar ao episódio original ""Star Wars: A New Hope"". A história se desenrola em torno de uma nova personagem, Rey, que se vê envolvida em uma luta entre a Resistência e a Primeira Ordem, espelhando a jornada de Luke Skywalker. Essa falta de inovação torna o enredo previsível e desprovido de surpresas.

Além disso, o filme parece mais interessado em criar mistérios e lançar sementes para futuras sequências do que em desenvolver uma narrativa coerente e satisfatória por si só. Os novos personagens são introduzidos de maneira intrigante, mas muitas de suas motivações e histórias de fundo são deixadas em segundo plano, deixando-os subdesenvolvidos e pouco envolventes. O enredo também deixa várias perguntas sem respostas, criando uma sensação de frustração em vez de satisfação."
"fuck the sequels except you force awakens but the other two are bad yeah this movie is nowhere near the ogs and prequels but for what it is its good rey here actually has potential to be great after rewatching it its boring a rehash of the new hope and rey is a mary sue"
"This film has more p(l)ot holes than the streets of Buffalo after a harsh winter.
Continuation of a story that pretty much ignores the old story, shallow characters and a absolutely terrible story!
Redo Star Wars totally or continue with the old story. Mixing both ended like the Titanic."
"Really good movie with constant action. It gives me John Wick vibes but with better combat and visuals. The story also wasn't too complex but it hit the major plot points that it needed to hit when starting this trilogy."
"The immediate issues with Star Wars: The Force Awakens are not noticeable at first, but aren't dangerous to it as a whole. Yes, it is a cardboard copy of A New Hope, as many of the elements do hit the same. But it manages to balance this familiarity with new faces that are acted to perfection, (Relatively) new worlds to explore, and in general a rich new trilogy to indulge with. (For now at least)"
"Star Wars 4 but made by Disney
I hate sequel trilogy"
"The failure of the sequels is because of this movie , it was the worst start we could've had.
This movie brought nothing new to the table , his sucess is entierly due to the nostalgia it gives.

Especially when considering that George lucas wrote a better story for the sequels they CHOOSE not to use

When a movie is based on nostalgia it's easier for fans to like it , rather than a movie that tries something.

This movie was made without passion or love for the saga."
"It's oke, but not really good"
"Well, it felt more like a reboot of the original movies then a continuation of the first three, and the three prequels. Its definitely a good movie for sure, but I'm not a big fan of it. But star wars fans, don't take my word seriously. Go watch the movie you'll love it."
"Not good not good at all."
"You know how some franchises develop
later films as an homage to the core content? Yeah, this is definitely not one of them. It takes critical parts of ‘canon' and perverts it rather than leveraging to tell the story of new characters.  So much wasted opportunity"
"This movie killed the unkillable... 

Everyone  involded in all 3 shuld be tried for crimes against humanity. I am not being sarcastic. They genuinely  harmed humanity  and should have to pay."
"Star wars didnt had a mary sue that was from star trek"
"No me gustó. Una saga que lleva años y años dándole a lo mismo"
"Recycled a lot of previous Star Wars plot and expressions without adding much to it. Characters didn't have much plot development. It was passable overall, but for a Disney budget, relatively a let down."
"This is how you continue a franchise towards a new generation of fans.
My only issue is the new characters are too, ""Mary Sue"" (if using the correct term).
Heroes need to be damaged, I grew up in the desert since 1981, trust me, it's not fun as a kid."
"A complete rip-off of ""The new Hope""... nearly scene by scene.... a terrible movie by a mediocre director!  i can't believe RT gave him a 93%.... Who paid you?"
"Tiene alguna cosa buena, pero muchas malas, está entretenida si no tienes nada que hacer, eso si. Mal final para Han Solo, horrible, sin emoción, ni epica... asqueroso. Lo peor es el personaje de Rey, no tiene sentido alguno, es una chatarrera que sabe pilotar naves espaciales a las que se acaba de subir y ni siquiera ha leído unas instrucciones mejor que pilotos entrenados porque... patata, sabe arreglarla mejor que su dueño porque... patata, sabe usar la fuerza sin entrenamiento porque... patata, vence a un jedi entrenado desde niño sin saber nada de la fuerza porque... patata.... ¡¡es un despropósito! no tiene recorrido, no tiene sentido, es el peor personaje de la historia de Star Wars, hasta Jar Jar Bins es maravilloso a su lado."
"Couldn't get past the first half hour, so bad."
"Disney Star Wars at its best. The plot is a remake of New Hope with new, stale, poorly written characters and the worst writing of any Star Wars movie (until its sequel). With all Disney could have done with the Star Wars license they chose to remake the first movie. Total Disappointment."
"it's a copy from ""A New Hope"", but it's watchable"
"Ray Palpatine subplants Luke Skywalker at the one who ""ACTUALLY"" saves the galaxy THANK YOU!   GIRL POWER 2023!   The only thing this film lacks is revealing Luke is non-binary before killing him off."
"J.J. Abrams restarts the franchise with many nostalgia throwbacks and familiar beats from the original. Although there were moments of excitement scattered across the running time, the story felt far too derivative too the point that it became tiresome to endure – and the new batch of characters were scarcely developed."
"Wanna know how to enrage an entire fanbase? Tear down their favourite characters and retcon the lore to fit a new narrative that cares nothing for good writing and everything about milking a franchise for all it's worth. Whole sequel trilogy is a disaster."
"The photography of this film is not anything."
"A bad start from a trilogy that should not be called Star Wars"
"The movie that ruined Star Wars, couldn't even tell you much of the plot except the stuff you've already seen in the past movies, couldn't stop checking the time in hopes that my misery would soon be over."
"the funnest star wars movie!"
"That movie killed star wars for me."
"Disney remake of Star Wars IV, but lamer with better CGI... damn the CGI is great."
"It's not what I was expecting. I don't get why Kylo Ren has to behave like a tantrum child. Great effects, great music, terrible script."
"If you had a Deja Vu feeling when you watched this movie, it is because ""The Force Awakens"" is a recycled version of ""A New Hope"", Star Wars for a new public, and not even its visual effects can distract you from that, but still manages to be entertaining."
"After watching this movie for the first time I was excited to see where our knew hero's adventures would lead them."
"OH WOW a new hope with extra steps, what s traffic wreck. Ask this time and ask they could come up with was to copy the originals."
"Just a mix of a new hope and empire strikes back! so bad and started off the worst handling of a movie franchise ever! Not well planned and story stolen from better writters! only one good action scene in the entire movie wasted potental so much hype and for nothing!"
"not starwars just like 8 and 9"
"The second worst Star Wars movie ever made."
"An untrained character that is strong with the force but has never hold a lightsaber, defeats a fully trained sith... that makes zero sense. 
No character development or storytelling for the new characters
Why is Luke, the main character on Episode 4-6 not a bigger part of this movie?"
"Love the movie. Rey having powers of a Jewish was awesome. Seeing Luke, Leia and han was amazing. Good action flick"
"The greatest 02 hours: and 16 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Movie is fine but has 0 creativity. It is a complete rip off of previous Star Wars movies. Beautifully made."
"STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is overall a good but flawed start to this Trilogy!"
"boring. slow, poorly paced. Not the worst that happens, but only a sign of the monstrosity to come. The movie had a few decent moments, but nothing that made it at all above average."
"Great action and story but Rey needs to face more consequences"
"re tooling of a new hhope, they didnt put luke , han and Leia on screen together, pointless movie, was done far better in 1977 with the same exact story."
"A great introduction to a new Star Wars trilogy! While there are many moments that blatantly copy A New Hope, and the Handling of Han Solo questionable at best, the film manages to restore faith in the Star Wars universe after the release of the uneven prequel trilogy that came before it. The new characters are fun and interesting with Finn's story being the most compelling as a deserted stormtrooper."
"With a similar plot to Star Wars (1977), this film still manages to execute a good storyline.  It's a fun ride and Harrison Ford's performance as Han Solo was compelling."
"I liked it in Cinema, yet due to „The Last Jedi"" everything you see in this movie isn‘t important at all. So basically this movie isn‘t relevant, except for what happens to Han I guess…"
"worst star wars movie ever. by far. director on crack?"
"One of the worst star wars movies I'd rather watch jar jar on repeat introduces a boring set of characters that just get what they want when they need it gets rid of one of the main characters from the star wars franchise lightsaber fights are snoozefests the only good things are the CGI and the fact that Chewbacca is still alive. Not as bad as the last jedi"
"Awful and irredeemable. The entire purpose of this movie is to cast off Canon and upset fans. One of the worst movies I have ever seen."
"Star Wars: The Force Awakens starts off the sequel trilogy with a bang. Including new and likeable characters and the characters from the OG films, its an impressive film that doesn't disappoint.

Rating: 77%"
"I think i have already watched something like that before... but the. characters were better overall"
"Really good, but not the originals"
"Not half bad despite the fact it follows the new hope event schedule like it's a blueprint for a Star Wars movie. I've enjoyed the performance of Daisy Ridley and John Boyega. Adam  Driver plays a rebelling teenager with daddy issue in darth vader armour with his acting being by best fine and my worst unbearable. Harrison Ford's performance screams ""I don't want to be here"". The movie is a fun nostalgia trip"
"Not a great start to the sequel trilogy, but not nearly as terrible as what would come after."
"""The Force Awakens"" is a great beginning to the end of the Star Wars Saga. Introducing enjoyable characters and bringing back old front runners to the show, ""The Force Awakens"" is a delightful return to Star Wars."
"The entire sequel trilogy was an affront to Star Wars, but this one was the smallest offender of the three."
"I give this movie 3/5 stars for its entertainment value, its homage to the Star Wars legacy, and its potential for future stories. It is a fun and exciting film that captures the spirit and charm of the original trilogy. However, I also think that some aspects of the film are disappointing, such as the lack of originality, the underdeveloped characters, and the unresolved mysteries. The film also suffers from some plot holes and inconsistencies that were later explained or ignored by the subsequent films. The film also fails to live up to the expectations and hype that surrounded it. Nevertheless, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a decent addition to the Star Wars franchise and a good introduction to a new generation of fans."
"this movie makes me so sad. because its actually really good. and everything that comes after is so, so bad."
"Stupid rubbish without inspiration and trying hard to be something (including stupid jokes, over PC and 'first timers' that ruin Star Wars instead of enhancing it), but staying nothing. Sad that this movie was added to the Saga."
"I appreciate all the actors for playing their parts and no disrespect to them. As an avid sw fan, this movie isn't getting accurately reviewed and deserves a lower score. I understand some people like these new movies, but not 85% of sw fandom. The original didn't make these movies or intended to make them, nor did the original's apprentice. All three are well funded fan films with ""subverted expectation"" dilemmas in story development. We aren't asking for much, make Jedi train to be good, dont disrespect established and well written characters, don't edit fight scenes by digitally deleting weapons from praetorian guard's hands, wtf is this animal titty milk scene"
"The story was the same thing as a new hope, but it was still pretty good. I wish they would've USED GEORGE LUCA""S IDEAS INSTEAD OF LYING TO HIM!!!"
"I spent years trying to justify this movie.... and I just cant. Disney has ruined my favorite thing from my childhood, and its sad to see."
"Very sceptical at first but found The Force Awakens to be a great addition to the Star Wars franchise. A decent mix of something old and something new with plenty of nostalgia. Very similar to A New Hope yes but this instalment does enough to get the new trilogy off the ground with audiences ready for more."
"This movie was ok but it's all down hill from here"
"I didn't like it but it was necessary. Get most of the nostalgia out of the way now. Was eager to see Episode VIII and where they would take it."
"Really disappointing."
"a lazy (and flawed) try to remake of a new hope beause Disney was afraid of making something new"
"JJ Abrams very creatively did a near shot for shot remake of A New Hope. How does he come up with this stuff?"
"Essentially a remake of A New Hope.  Promising start to the new trilogy, but no new ground really."
"This movie definitely isn't one of the best but it is in my opinion the best sequel trilogy movie despite the low bar."
"Just a rip off of a new hope, jj Abrams has no imagination"
"Good new characters wasted on a terrible lazy plot that pointlessly kills off one of the best characters in the series. And this is sadly the BEST of the sequels."
"Just a knock off of the originals."
"Lazily written. They disregarded the progression of the original trilogy to give the new generation a revamped version of it. Some characters are retained to give continuity, but they inexplicably behave like morons. It's like having someone who has no understanding of Star Wars write a sequel, so the only thing he can do is a bad imitation. The result is It's like ""A New Hope"" but bought on a scam online shop, with a shining finish but empty inside."
"are you kidding? did anyone proofread this?"
"Star Wars: The Force Awakens...Pretty Good."
"The Force Awakens isn't bad, but it isn't good. The story brings nothing new to the universe, and actually almost exactly replicates the plot of A New Hope but with more special effects and over the top stakes. The actors and special effects folks did a fantastic job, however the plot, writing, and creativity leaves an immense amount to be desired. As a die hard star wars fan, this movie is a disservice to the franchise."
"The Force Awakens is a decent entry point to a new series. Firstly, the VFX, sound design, score and 'secondary' features of a good movie are very well done. The characters are more or less unique and flavoursome in their own right, particularly Finn, a deserter stormtrooper with an exciting arc set up for him. These characters are backed by good performances - actors are clearly passionate about being in Star Wars and do their best when the script challenges them.
However, the main feature of any movie, the story, is disappointingly weak. Despite some very interesting setups which leave you hanging on for more by the end, it requires investment into the next installments which may (or may not...) satisfy.
It's essentially a retelling of A New Hope, but arguably deals with these same story beats worse. This also means it does not take risks, something that The Last Jedi takes in the extreme opposite direction. It drip feeds interesting plot points and ideas but does not deliver by the end, leaving viewers wanting for the sequel. This could be seen as a good or bad thing...Although with the benefit of hindsight I would say these setups do not deliver, sullying a lot of the experience of The Force Awakens for viewers coming back after the conclusion of the sequel trilogy. 
The basic but timeless story however is why it is so rewatchable and digestible, held together by good action and performances. 
This film is decent as a Star Wars sequel, and middling as a standalone movie. 3/5."
"Meh, could have been a lot better."
"GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD good 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
"Nothing new, nothing smart, no surprises, strong incoherences and implausibilities, tasteless soundtrack, that new trilogy seems to have nothing to tell. Yet the picture is beautiful."
"I personally really like this movie. Its entertaining. Really good cgi. Funny and has really sad and heartbreaking moments. While Ray is the worst lead character out of the movies. Kylo ren and the supporting cast is really good."
"Not Star Wars. Not even good enough to qualify it as a cringe fanfiction legend."
"The Force Awakens marks the first Star Wars film produced after the franchise's acquisition by Disney, and it served as a highly anticipated return to the galaxy far, far away. The film's director, J.J. Abrams, had big shoes to fill, and overall, he did a commendable job of bringing the Star Wars universe back to life.

One of the most positive aspects of The Force Awakens was its cast. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac all gave compelling performances as new characters Rey, Finn, and Poe, respectively. Harrison Ford's reprisal of Han Solo was also a highlight, bringing a welcome dose of nostalgia to the film. The chemistry between the actors was believable and helped to drive the story forward.

The film's cinematography was also impressive, with lush landscapes and detailed spacecraft designs. The action scenes were well-choreographed and visually stunning, making for an exciting viewing experience. Additionally, the film's use of practical effects over CGI was a welcome return to the techniques used in the original trilogy.

However, one criticism of the film is that its plot felt overly familiar, following a similar structure to the original Star Wars film. The villain, Kylo Ren, felt like a copy of Darth Vader, with a similar costume design and an obsession with the dark side. The film's reliance on nostalgia also made it feel at times like a retread of previous films rather than a fresh take on the Star Wars universe.

Another issue with The Force Awakens was its pacing. The film had a lot of ground to cover in introducing new characters and setting up a new story, and at times it felt rushed. This made it difficult to fully invest in the story and the characters.

Overall, Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens is an enjoyable addition to the Star Wars franchise. While it may not have taken many risks in terms of its plot and character development, it still provided a thrilling action-packed adventure with a great cast and impressive visuals."
"Basically a New hope reboot, zero originality, and a recycled history."
"Meh its just OK.  Would have been great but they had to do another death star scenario.   Twice was enough.   Three times gets a bit ridiculous don't you think.   The worse part is that it was a foreshadowing of the awful writing and ideas the next two movies would do.   It just gets worse from here. 

Hoping someday Disney fails, and someone buys Star Wars from the wreckage.  Then they can throw out these garbage movies from canon and take the the universe forward in a more sane and realistic fashion.   Star Wars isn't supposed to be like a marvel comic movie.   But of idiots."
"I remember walking out of the cinema thinking... wow that was bad.. I personally didn't like it. some people do. let's agree to disagree XD"
"The beginning of the end for Star Wars."
"This felt like a new hope 2.0. It was fun watching a new star wars film, but I would not bother to watch this again. This was the best film in the most recent star wars trilogy though!"
"So much potential.  This film got by on the romanticism of a new star wars film and the excitement of seeing our heroes onscreen again.  There were some strange narrative choices, and overall it felt average but ended on a note of hope, which gave the overall film a rocket boost.  The fact the story went where it did, makes the film even worse."
"Looking back after several years it was a surprisingly strong film.  Filed with energy and promise."
"it's fine nothing offensive"
"while rest of the sequel trilogy turned out to be absolute trash. however, this movie is pretty good. Finn and Rey actually have pretty good arcs in this movie. Finn having an arc of turning to the side of good and getting over his time with the first order is a unique arc for a star wars character and Rey having an arc about wanting her family to return and yearning to belong, goes great with that. The only reason I dislike this movie is I can't watch it without thinking about what the sequels did to this premise"
"This movie was the best of the sequels to the original. It set up some many exciting plots and ideas it made me feel the excitement and joy the originals did and feel the same joy as I had at the prequels as a kid. It has to be up there as one of my favorite Star Wars movies."
"My personal favorite Star Wars film of all. The magic is captured by Daisy Ridley's brilliant performance as Rey and Harrison Ford returning as Han Solo is truly one of my favorite moments in cinematic history. Han Solo confronting his son, Kylo Ren, was the best part of this movie."
"It is so bad that it ruined all my childhood memories about one of the greatest movies"
"Wow it has been a while since the last Star Wars"
"Least terrible of the new trilogy. still terrible writing though."
"A very nice and cool way of starting the sequels. But after this, things go down hill."
"the sh*tshow begins, thank you disney"
"Of the three this was the better film, it allowed you an opportunity to actually understand where they were going with it. Even though the train crashed by the third movie. This is the one that you could watch if you did not wanna watch the others. But you want to know what happens and where it goes, so this entire trilogy just should be locked in the Disney vault."
"This is Episode IV ""New Hope"" repainted with modern colors and sold again under a different name. A Hero from a desert planet and a droid with something important are chased around the galaxy by an evil masked guy, who ends up killing his old (and Hero's newly found) mentor figure as the Hero is watching from a distance. Evil empire with a planet-destroying weapon included. We've seen it all before."
"Oh dear... there aren't many movies I fell asleep in."
"Not a bad movie. A good start to a series that flopped."
"One-dimensional, uninteresting characters, an unoriginal story, unconvincing special effects. This is what the death of a billion dollar franchise looks like. ""The Force"" should've stayed asleep in bed."
"I just rewatched the entire Skywalker Saga and this is the only good Disney sequel… I like how Finn is written, he is a man trying to find his way in the galaxy and succeeds by joining the Resistance. I also like Poe, BB-8, Leia, Han, and Chewie. Just Rey isn't written well but not horrible (Unlike  TLJ & RoS) The score is okay and the SFX is really good."
"ahh yes the newest form of touture... disney wars. my gold fish could write a better script than this and its been dead for 8 years. i would recommend you do something better for your health like breaking both your legs not eating for 2 weeks and riding a crockidile in to the path of an on coming train. i was hoping disney would do something good with starwars. im sorry for beliving in you disney, it wont happen agian. this was simply an affront of humanity. kathleen kennedy, Someday you'll go far. And I really hope you stay there. You're a gray sprinkle on a rainbow cupcake. i would reccomend this for absoloultly no one cause no matter what crimes you have done no one deserves this."
"I can't even believe this move has an 86 score, it was just not that good, it goes way way way too big with the force and the scale of everything, and crams every last piece of Star Wars down your throat instead of just giving you a good story."
"This is the movie that ruined Star Wars OT and set a bad example for the subsequent movies in the sequel trilogy."
"damn that was just so bad."
"The best out of the sequel trilogy it feels like a roller coaster throughout 8/10"
"The worst Star Wars film of all time, has no plot and characters had so much potential . The only good bit is that they have a lady Jedi"
"Please stop making movies without real fan directors. :("
"A really fun re introduction to Star Wars!"
"the next chapter in Star Wars saga feels too much like its copying the originals, but its still exciting and a very entertaining movie."
"Uninspired cash grab."
"The best of the Disney trilogy. The movie is made worse by the two that come after it."
"This is not my Star Wars. Its a poorly made copy of the original with unlikable characters."
"Its ok-er that the other two movies, but still bad."
"Un refrito insoportable de Star Wars IV, todas las escenas ridiculas y sin sentido."
"Nothing original, literally just a retelling of the first star wars, (Child is picked up from desert planet, they go on space adventure and meet up with rebellion to destroy planet killing weapon, mentor dies to black masked villain, and the MC manages to win the day by stop overthinking things and trust their gut- trust the force.) but they nailed the atmosphere. It feels like Star Wars, just with a fresh coat of paint, and new characters."
"You are better off just watching the original movies."
"Kind of copied the original, but the set up is there and the characters are good. Just sucks they are later ruined and you don't care about them all later down the line in the trilogy."
"👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩"
"Have u ever wanted to be blue balled by one of the most successful franchises ever! Well here ya go. It starts off strong, but does quickly. It had potential but it disappoints more than u disappointed your dad"
"Another great star wars movie right beside Rogue One"
"Just a lazy movie that copied most of the plot of the original movie without any of the originality, interesting characters or novelty. 2 stars for the great visuals, but everything else was lacking."
"I thought this was a welcome return to form for the Star Wars franchise. It feels nostalgic, charming and has a sense of what came before it. However if you're looking for anything new in the Star Wars verse you're not going to find it here."
"Not a bad way to reboot the franchise essentially. Kind of similar plot to a new hope but it does enough new stuff to not feel the same."
"As a starwars fan I'm very disappointed inthis movie mainly because it's scared to do anything new or to reference prequels.
If it was my personal opinion I would've given it 1 star but objectively it's truly average. Very disappointing."
"Dispite this being a ripoff of Episode IV it´s still the best of the sequels. Interesting new characters and great visuals. Acting is solid. Everything looks like you can really touch it (unlike in the prequels). The real shame is that you never see Han, Luke and Leia together. I wonder if it was really necessary to have Leia´s and Han´s relationship fail but I guess the new generation of filmmakers can leave nothing good from the past untouched..."
"Finally I can enjoy this franchise, apparently all it took was to remove Lucas."
"Should stay in drafts.... something nobody needed but somehow we got it."
"Just like the rest of the sequel trilogy it was just a remake of its original counterpart with nothing original added to it."
"A disastrous story only mitigated by the nice visuals. Clearly no-one cared to try and bring in new characters in a way that would build on the existing ones or would align with the existing lore."
"Pretty much a good movie, some scenes are quite bad, but generally a good movie."
"My hopes were high for this, it started off good, but then it seems the direction gave up. It's OK. Kylo Ren was the best character, and when you find yourself hoping the bad guy wins, it's a bad sign for the rest of the movie."
"Was so exciting at the time, yet formulaic retread disappointed in the end."
"Good start, this could have been the first movie of a great trilogy. Sadly, it went downhill from there"
"We could have had so much, but we got this."
"This is a very overrated movie.  It pretty much copied the Original Trilogy but worse.  Disney should have just done what George Lucas planned."
"Great start to the sequel trilogy. Great cast and great story"
"New Hope remake, but worth watching"
"Why did this trilogy happen?  So bad.  But hey, this one isn't quite as awful as the other two."
"The film starts well, although from the beginning there is a feeling of déjà vu and an obvious lack of attention to constructing on the previous films. It simply starts again, with new villains, a new order of villains, emphasizing from the credits that everything that was done in the last trilogy was in vain. Okay... But then, from a certain point in the movie until the end, the movie is... a direct replica of Star Wars A New Hope! Seriously? On top of that, in addition to the very empty, cheesy and already heard dialogues about the Jedis or the force, the movie completely ruins some fundamental principles of Star Wars: how can someone without training fight a Sith and use a lightsaber decently? The film looks like a showbiz maneuver to recruit a new generation, but for Star Wars fans, it may look like a betrayal."
"It is basically a remake of A New Hope, but a damn fine one with thrilling pacing and superior visuals. It also reminds us of what a movie star Harrison Ford is. Nearly perfect. (I do not care for the casting blunder for Kylo. What were they thinking?)"
"An alright start to a new series."
"should have never been made."
"Honestly it is just a cash grab and a remake of Episode IV. Not a bad movie to watch but it could have been better."
"The film is a mere carbon copy of the beloved first film now titled ""A New Hope"". The creators showed no initiative or imagination and ultimately began a trilogy that would drain the life out of the franchise. On its own it's a watchable movie. But that's only due to the success of it's copied template."
"Rey's setup is good, ending fantastic. Bit gimmicky at times though."
"star wars is all you have to say"
"This movie represents the beginning of the end of Star Wars."
"The best visual effects ever done in a movie!"
"A nostalgic reboot of the first Star Wars film. 
Rated: 3/5"
"At first I thought ok that was good but the more time I spent with it I saw it was just episode 4 again with some minor difernces."
"A tear-jerking ode to the series fans know and love, the force is with this one."
"The best star wars movie 
It had it all 
It was and stil is so awesome"
"The best film out of the sequel trilogy but that is not saying much."
"its a bad reboot of a new hope, Rey is like live action Mulan no training no growth all power its boring. For me disney butcher Star Wars"
"A rather soulless and unnecessary rehash, but could've at least spawned a half decent trilogy with some effort. Well, spoiler alert, the next two were quite poor, making this entry feel like a bit of a waste of time.

At least the Lego game was alright ..."
"Seems like we missed an opportunity here. So why is Han gotta be a lower. It was meh"
"An almost pointless new trilogy at least had it’s moments in mostly this movie."
"I just love it, everything!"
"Why was there a need to do this? The story is a dull remake of Episode IV. There is no sense in this, this first order comes out of the blue and who are they? Who are they fighting with? What happened to the old republic? Abrahms doesn't care he makes movies as if nothing before has happened. What an ego must this director have? Well I don't buy it, or better said I bought the ticket but this is the last Star Wars movie of Disney that I will watch in a theather."
"Great start to the new trilogy."
"Muchas veces esta película se lleva algunos golpes por culpa de sus sucesoras, pero es una muy buena película, que plantea muchas pequeñas tramas que lamentablemente Johnson se encargó de desaparecer en los últimos Jedi."
"The ultimate Star Wars Experience! It survives on some sly patchy plot reasoning through break out performances of its stellar cast. They should have quit while they were ahead"
"I love this movie more than a new Hope. Sue me idc"
"The Force Awakens is an impressive start to this trilogy. The new characters they introduced showed so much potential. Great work by JJ Abrams. This movie is perfect example of professional filmmaking. Love it."
"I think all movie makers should take a break from making science fiction movies. Poor acting, bad story and underwhelming pacing. These days film makers rely heavily on special effects and cgi to prop up their mediocre movie productions. There is no intimacy nor relevance to this hum bug."
"This movie successfully takes us back to a galaxy far far away. We are actually there once more. The only Disney SW movie so far, that has actually been able to do just that. The adventure lives on."
"It was a good beginning of a new era and a new generation. This movie gives us nostalgia to the original franchise back with a great build up to the new generation."
"One of the year's most hyped films, a culmination of millions in marketing, and a very loyal fan base promised to bring record crowds to cinemas this December to see Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens.  With director J.J. Abrams at the helm of the first of the new trilogy, as a fan himself, he decided to take things back to Star Wars' roots.  While most love the film, and critic and audience reviews have been overwhelmingly positive, some tout the film as a redundant and uninspired rehash of the original 1977 film.  I can understand this opinion of the film with the same basic story arc and a larger, more lethal version of the death star. But, I never really went into the film expecting anything different.  This is a continuation of the series as a whole and a way to bring back long time fans, as well as create new ones for today's generation. What better way to do that then go back to its roots but have the technology to better portray the more fantasy elements.  Luckily, it didn't go too C.G.I. crazy and come off plastic and fake looking like most of the environments in the prequel films. Instead, we find a perfect balance of old and new!
     I can very easily say I liked the film significantly better than any of the prequels (and even better than Star Wars: Episode VI- Return of the Jedi, but not quite up to original Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope. And, it doesn't touch the perfection of Star Wars: Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back.)  Overall, this most recent Star Wars is a wonderful marriage of the two previous trilogies, a wonderful introduction for new Star Wars fans, as well as fans of the original trilogy, too.  I really enjoyed seeing the original characters again after not seeing them in their respective roles since 1983. I also loved the new characters and their interactions with the original characters and the Star Wars universe in general.  Both Daisy Ridley and John Boyega do a good job in their new character roles and they look like they are having a blast, too!  Seeing Harrison Ford as Han Solo with Chewbacca on the Millennium Falcon, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill was all quite nostalgic and it garnered a ton of audience applause too!
     Is the setup a bold new and original script? No. But, it's a damn good film nonetheless - exactly what I wanted and more!  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, even for a moment, and that is something rare with today's films. It had enough heart and comedic sprinkling to make it more human and approachable for today's audience.  I was captivated from start to finish and that is what a big blockbuster like this should do. J.J. Abrams pulled it off wonderfully.  While he isn't directing the next two films in the trilogy, he is still producing, involved, and most importantly, excited as a fan himself for future installments!"
"the cgi  is med 3.5  star"
"I liked it but couldn't love it. it felt like a remake of episode IV but not done as well and they glossed over too many questions. rare combination of bored and confused at times"
"Force Awakens is an okay Star Wars film.  The action is great!  The storyline could've been more original.  At times the movie feels like a copy of A New Hope."
"I enjoyed this, as somewhat of a Star Wars newbie. I saw 'Rogue One' a while back and thought it was ok but I haven't seen other Star Wars films (that I can remember). I'm glad I gave this a go - I wasn't sure I could necessarily follow the main gist of the story but I did actually. The CGI is very good/impressive, as you'd expect. Its pretty engrossing and of course I enjoyed watching BB-8 - gotta love a cute miniature robot type being!. I think you could enjoy this if your not a massive fan of the franchise - its an enjoyable, entertaining sci-fi fantasy film with some decent CGI and a good cast, so it's worth a watcg, yeah. I would recommend this film, yes."
"I think its a good movie, but it has alot of problems and unanswered plotholes. You either love this movie or you dont like it very much. Im not sure what to think about what they did to hans character and how they just killed him of in the first movie of the trilogy. But it does have some really good moments, i also thought rey was a little annoying."
"Essentially a reboot of the old movies, with weak character development, bad pacing, and average story-telling."
"The Force Awakens brings back the series to its former glory and stature, by adding in both iconic characters and new characters in an action-packed, humorous sci-fi picture filled with crisp visuals and memorable moments."
"Monumentally ugly continuance to the original trilogy—how do I know?  I WAS THERE!  I was there in line for the first time it came to my hometown theatre and I went to see it seven nights in a row!  I was awestruck by the original movie.  This disgusting CGI piece of waste dishonors everything about its most honored and beloved original trilogy, and even the more dishonorable prequel trilogy!  

Pros:  Seeing the wonderful Carrie Williams and Harrison Ford again in their signature roles.  And seeing the sometimes execrable Mark Hamill back as Luke albeit thankfully with his mouth shut.

Cons:  Extremely WEAK plot, bad acting by the current cast (save for Oscar Isaac—he saves the flick!) and just the overall AMATEUR directing by JJ Abrams.  Stick to comics, JJ.  You really are out of your element with perhaps the most beloved SciFi franchise beyond Star Trek.  Your touch on this one proved your are either on drugs, or brain damaged."
"A very fun movie. A little similar to A New Hope to be sure, but the acting, comedy and action more than make up for it. Kylo Ren is a very intriguing villain, a cocky hothead to contrast with stoic Vader in the previous movies. Adam Driver is truly amazing, bringing the character to life in a very convincing way. It's fun and exciting, and I don't know what else you could want from a Star Wars movie, especially a first one. 8.2./10"
"Very good and a worthwhile entry into a beloved saga"
"Wow, JJ Abrams is nothing if not consistent, it reminded me of the previews of Lost back when it was on. If you're a fan of close ups featuring panting, panicked, wide eyed faces, then THIS IS YOUR MOVIE! Seriously, it was a good movie, but we get that the situation is tense, we don't need the relentless close ups to establish the drama. The plot was kind of a repeat of Episode 4, but everything was bigger and.....MORE! You would want to watch this though before going to the Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker, which were better."
"Main character isn't all that great and it doesn't make sense for a storm trooper (John Boyega) to fight a sith lord and hold his own"
"JJ gets credit for making Star Wars look like Star Wars again following the overblown CGI in the prequels.  In particular, the first 15min as we get to live Rey's sad life salvaging scrap on Jakku are a great introduction to her character.  That said, there's too much copy/paste from earlier plots here, making it feel like a retread of A New Hope.  Especially as there is no explanation why we find the good guys fighting as scrappy rebels against yet another evil empire.  Whatever happened to the promise at the end of Return of the Jedi?"
"Movie is recycling whole saga, but had potential to grow into something bigger.
Well ... at least it had potential. 
R.I.P sequels"
"A good reboot, although too much like episode IV."
"Loved this movie, Fin is such a breathe of fresh air into the star wars world. Love Rey being the new face of the story. Def recommend watching if your a star wars fan"
"Feels overly long and Rey's entire character is flat and mediocre at best"
"Great beginning, but Disney destroyed their new villan within the first minutes."
"Everything wrong with modern writing and directing all neatly wrapped up in one terrible movie."
"I love this movie. The visuals are amazing, that action is fun, and there are also some good emotional scenes. It gets hate because people don't think it is a good sequel to the OT, but I think it would've been fine is there were a prequal to this movie. It goes from the Empire falling in ROTJ to there being a new order that is taking over the galaxy, so it seems like nothing happened. I wish there were scenes where we got to see some of the new republic, but that's doesn't change my love for this movie. It introduced so many interesting new characters, and also showed some old ones. It set up the next movie perfectly, but sadly episode 8 didn't live up to the expectations."
"Yes, the movie is fantastic and definitely worth seeing, but there are several issues, the biggest of which is how cliche it is. The film's beats and plot points feel incredibly similar to the OT from the very first scene. The film never really establishes anything new because it strives so hard to be unique. People that claim it is a remake are not quite as far off, in my opinion. I was also let down by the character of Finn. Boyega does a terrific job, but his is a very underdeveloped and erratic character. felt more like comedy relief than anything else, which is unfortunate because he almost deserves to be a lead character."
"Best of Movies/TV Series Collection"
"Honestly, this movie was just a complete rehash of A New Hope with a splattering of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The entire plot was a beat for beat repeat of what happened in the first Star Wars movie but just with different characters. There's nothing original going on here except the main villain is a comical and sniffling weakling that really doesn't create any peril or something for the protagonist to really overcome. In fact, he's easily dispatched by untrained Jedi's at the end showing that he isn't much of a challenge to overcome. The only thing that gave this movie any value was strong performances by Harrison Force, Carrie Fisher (God rest her soul), John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Peter Mayhew and Anthony Daniels. That made it worth popcorn, but that's all about it."
"It wasn't particularly riveting, however it held my attention very well. The plot feels fairly derivitive, but the VFX are stunning and I'm a very big fan of the new cast, just a fun group of people, and I love to see the diversity."
"A fun introduction to a new era of Star Wars. Lacking some originality and character progression for the lead (she seems to have it all already), but great to see old faces back in a galaxy far, far away."
"Same thing but with a new cast mostly.. .meh."
"This movie is a reboot of the original Star Wars film for a new generation. Unfortunately, I was one of the old generation of children who grew up watching the original films in the 1970s, so I didn't really want a reboot but a continuation of the story George Lucas started all those years ago. Since I also didn't like the story, the new characters or the handling of the old characters it probably doesn't come as a surprise that I find this film to be another bad reboot."
"It gets off as a well done star wars movie, only because it repeated a formula that is pretty darn good"
"I wasn't impressed at all but as time has passed it's gotten worse. I have seen the movie twice. I have no reason to watch it again."
"In Retrospective this Movie prevented us the chance to see Lea, Han and Luke in one Scene, one adventure again. I will never forgive JJ Abrams for this.
The State of the Universe he created was bland and boring and a very bad start for the Sequel Trilogy. The expanded universe did this way better. A shame.

The Movie had some neat ideas though like the knights of ren, the force power of stopping a laser shot in mid air, Kylo's Mask and Voice, Snoke, the mystery about Luke, a defecting stormtrooper...

All those ideas died on the way to Rise of Skywalker."
"A welcome rehash of an old plot line. The new cast/characters are great."
"Ok start to the trilogy ruined in retrospect by subsequent movies"
"At the time it came out I mostly enjoyed it, despite it being basically a reskin of the original Star Wars from 1977. Now we know that all the questions it raised, which launched a thousand fan theories, were just more J.J. Abrams ""mystery boxes"" to which he himself hadn't bothered to come up with any answers. Worse, Kathleen Kennedy and Disney had no plan in place for the new trilogy, letting Rian Johnson do whatever he wanted in Ep 8 and then letting J.J. do whatever he wanted again in Ep 9, so it's no wonder they were so whiplash-inducing and contradictory."
"Lucasfilm had made two great Star Wars films then four stinkers in a rows. My hopes were raised when I heard Disney was not going to follow George Lucas's plan for the next three films. I expected that Disney would hire the best writers available, bring Luke, Han, and Leia together and use them to revitalize the moribund Star Wars saga that has been sketched out for several films.

But Bob Iger is totally incompetent. Instead, we got an incompetent director who did what is effectively a remake of the third films which was a remaking of the first film. The entire story makes no sense."
"This was a terrible movie that abandoned the original storylines in order to push their modern social agenda. Luke Skywalker is pushed aside and they try to develop new heroes but they fail. I'd skip it."
"All though the rest of the sequels are probably in the list of worst movies ever made, This one isn't all that bad. It sets up some good plots and brings in new interesting characters. It is a bit like New Hope, but is still a decent installment. Sadly all that potential is wasted in the sequels. I think it is a fine movie, but nothing great."
"Feel good recreation of the original story, but nothing new. Questionable choice to ruin afterglow of the original trilogy."
"So much promise so much hope. Alas it was not to be for this trilogy."
"Almost a shot-for-shot remake of A New Hope, but was still a strong start for Disney Star Wars.  Definitely entertaining and set up a lot of very interesting plot questions."
"Bad movie, one of the worst ive ever watched"
"When a girls is taking the role of the Jedi, it is just ruined."
"Excellent Acting, Editing and Very Well Paced Sci-Fi adventure. The characters are all charming and have chemistry. The Soundtrack is phenomenal also. The Action Scenes are extremely well done and stand out as well with really good CGI that never feels oversaturated because there is lots of practical sets. This has an extremely fast pacing to it that feels natural and a thrill ride like but balances slow moments beautifully. The only flaw I have with this movie is it is basically a retelling of Star Wars (1977) & but its done extremely well. Especially as this goes on it feels more and more like familiar events, pacing, and structurally just like the original. A big giant planet killer needs to be destroyed with one weak spot, Han Solo is Ben Kenobi, A droid has secret plans, they have to escape the station, they leave a desert planet in the Falcon, Rey is Luke, etc.  If this was a stand alone movie it would be a All Time Classic no question. But because it is a Sequel and part of a franchise I has to be judged on different merits. I will say that this improves every technical aspect that the prequels had problems with. The dialogue is worlds better, there isn't emotionless styles of acting, this is never boring, the CGI never feels oversaturated, the lightsaber fights are way more realistic and similar to the original trilogy and isn't trying to be hip and cool like the prequels. A Sci-Fi, 2010's, Adventure Classic. It's lack of originality is what holds it back from being an All Time Classic."
"Star Wars: the Force Awakens shakes this long dormant franchise back to life. This movie is absolutely entertaining from start to finish and it is a visual feast for the eyes. Upon re-watches, this movie does have some glaring plot holes, character motivations and development started to show their issues. From time to time and depending on your mood, this movie does seem more like a remake than a sequel. Having said that, it is still unenjoyable film."
"Aburrida, un remake mal hecho bastante predecible, una decepción. Star Wars morira ante el mandato de Disney, un asco el porvenir de esta gran saga hecha por george lucas"
"MemberBerries. thats the best summary of this movie I can think of. almost everything about this movie is based on nostalgia and fanservice. Some fans might like that but this entire movie is just a remake/nostalgia fest."
"A mediocre way to reboot a franchise."
"I think that given the circumstances, this was the best way to launch a new trilogy at the time that it was released. Unfortunately, disney majorly fumbled the plans for the other films, but we'll get to that shortly. While I don't feel that this one is great, there's a lot to like here. The new characters are fun. The action is well done. The story is more than passable. It is essentially a mirror image, soft reboot of A New Hope. Though I don't think that's great, I think it does work well, and brings some familiarity as a way to jump back in. I would have been fine with it if what proceeded was better. So I see this as a middle of the road entry, not great, not terrible.

"esta pelicula logra reanimar el universo de star wars con personajes viejos y nuevos"
"As a Star Wars fan since childhood, this movie achieved to be the first one that made me literally sleep in the movie theater. I wish it was longer so that I could finish my sleeping cycle."
"Decent not bad not great"
"the force awakins its the best out of the new trilogy but they to KILL HAN SOLO THEY JUST HAD TO KILL HIM WHEN I SAW THIS FIRST TIME IN CINEMA I WAS LIKE NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MY CHILDHOOD WAS DEAD FOREVER THANKS DISNEY . You were supposed to destroy the bad things in childhoods not join them bring balance to the force not leave it in darkness."
"Good movie, good characters definitely a good Star Wars movie"
"Has further rendered the prequels pointless, mainly because there are distinct references to relevant back stories in this film, tying certain characters together, concerning the 30 years since all events in the last movies, as there was in the original 3 movies, in relation to Darth Vader on that occasion. In order to tell these new stories fully they would have to sandwich movies in the middle of Return of the Jedi and Force Awakens, but of course they don't need to do that (though the Mandalorian has now done a little bit there, sort of), allowing our own imagination to fill in the gaps, with a few hints, in much the same way fans, casual or otherwise, did upon first watching the original trilogy way back when, as indeed this movie does too. So, I would like to suggest that the prequels are now redundant. Having just watched the original trilogy, though annoyingly with all the extra gumph George Lucas tacked on to it for DVD and Bluray, the Force Awakens feels as though it really does belong, and works very well as a story occurring 30 years later. Much of that is attributed to the way this movie was filmed, using a lot of practical effects, as opposed to relying entirely on CGI. There was something that really did disappoint me when I first watched it, leaving me quite shocked, a character's general absence, however in retrospect, later, I was able to appreciate all other aspects of the movie, character development, story progression, etc, and began to question if I really needed what I thought I was going to, and wanted to see."
"The greatest 02 hours: and 16 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"its a remake of the new hope no real creativity and it only celebrates one bit of star wars"
"Actually the new sw trilogy dont started so bad with this one."
"Kinda old how its always one small ship from the good guys destroying one massive ship of the bad guys, however the rest of the story is very original and overall flows very well. Small things you could knit pick at like how can Fin last even seconds in a light saber battle. Especially against someone trained like Kylo. Rey makes more sense perhaps because of her natural ability with the force. Enjoyed the movie though. Great acting and cinematography."
"My far the best movie in this trilogy, but the only thing worse than this are the movies that follow. The protagonist never really struggles, and is only powerful for the sake of being powerful. Nothing feels earned, she ""learns"" to use the force by somehow hacking the antagonists brain using the force. Female leads can be great in action movies if done correctly, Look at characters like Ellen Ripley, Sarah Conner, Alita, Clarice Starling, Zoe Washburne, or Leia in the original trilogy."
"It pays 0 respect to the original content it is based on, and seems to only use Star Wars as a skin and nothing more."
"It's flawed but good. If Disney weren't so incompetent we could have gotten a nice trilogy."
"This is some Mickey mouse bs"
"a good movie, nothing new..."
"My rating for the film is a 8.5/10"
"Watching this movie without looking at the films which come out after, this movie is made by star wars fans for star wars fans. This film had me excited for what's coming next even if what came next was garbage. I enjoy this film and have watched it multiple times."
"Not absolutely bad but it could have been much better. Little intresting action and politics, I wouldn't really reccomend it."
"Just a remake of a new hope but worse.."
"Even though it isn't quite as good as any of the original trilogy movies it still manages to be a very good star wars movie. It is very fun and I like most of the characters are their dialog. But it still has problems."
"While it wasn't awful this movie seems like a cheap copy of A New Hope and a disservice to the diehard fans. It had a lot of potential to set up the rest of the trilogy for great things. A mostly coherent story and full of impressive visual effects makes it the easiest of the sequels to watch."
"This movie does some things right and some very wrong. 
Our introduction to Rey is well done as it sets her character up well as a hopeless scavenger living in and AT-AT (which was for some reason on jakku?) Finn and Poe were both given a lot of potential and I think that Kylo ren is the best part of this movie as him trying to live up to vaders legacy is an interesting motive for an antagonist which was not very well expanded upon by ep 8&9
Bad things:
Han dies
It recycles a new hopes plot 
How the hell did Rey fly the millennium falcon, a massive freighter, through a star destroyer with no previous experience of flying"
"GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍"
"Ok movie for beginning of the post sequels of the Star Wars franchise. The new characters of the movie are likable. The plot is decent and decent work from JJ Abrams directing this. But his work will be thrown up on after the following sequels, Last Jedi and the Rise of Skywalker. Say goodbye to Harrison Ford (Han Solo). Good also of the return of most of the original cast as well the new cast."
"Yeah, this is better than CATS."
"Not too fond of this one chaps"
"The problem here is we have already seen this movie. It's called a New Hope. This is just a remix. There are so many places it could have gone. It was supposed to be Episode 7, not a reboot.🤦‍♂️ However this is one Of John Williams best Star Wars scores."
"Good lord... Look at all the paid-for positive reviews for this film. Disney really needed to try and convince the public it was good, with a paid-for film critic blitzkrieg. Though it was--- obviously--- infantile trash in every respect. A bevy of toddlers could have created a more engaging, palatable, and less outlandishly farcical and stupid film. It's both painful and mind-numbingly shocking that anyone would even speak of this film in a manner other than disdainfully."
"It's basically the bad reboot of The New Hope!"
"Disney revives Star Wars to charm new audiences with a story that's all too familiar.

Director J.J. Abrams (Super 8) directs his sci-fi adventure Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) with a heartfelt love of Star Wars. His visual style captures the grandeur of Star Wars' scope and the splendor of the wide shot vistas and earnest character driven story. Cinematographer Dan Mindel recaptures that old magic in his stunning ultra wide shots like Rey on her speeder blazing across the deserts of Jakku in search of antiques in ruins and purpose in life. The use of red and blue lighting for the Han and Kylo scene is quite beautiful. The Force Awakens happily uses many lovely close-up shots of Daisy Ridley's expressive face. There's some awkward fast zooms and a cluster of indecipherable action sequences, but The Millennium Falcon's evasive flight and Rey versus Kylo's lightsaber duel are brilliantly shot.

Abrams was surprisingly apt for directing Disney's Star Wars sequel opener, but he clearly should have been given the entire trilogy, so that he could create a coherent story across these movies. Producer Kathleen Kennedy made the baffling decision to have Abrams direct the first and third movies, while Rian Johnson directed the second, destroying any narrative structure or coherence across these pictures. Abrams loves the practical sets and puppets with the mystique of The Force. He revitalized Star Wars' magical aura for an entire new generation of children to enjoy. I could not help but smile during The Force Awakens movie theater showing I went to with all the little girls that were so excited to see themselves represented with Rey as a Star Wars heroine. I had a blast getting to know Rey and feeling like Star Wars was back.

However, writers Lawrence Kasdan, Michael Arndt, and J.J. Abrams himself basically ripped off A New Hope in trying to introduce Star Wars as a series for new viewers. I just feel hollow knowing Disney wasted their chance to center The Force Awakens' story around Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo training new Jedi and rebel fighters. Carrie Fisher is dead now, sadly. So we'll never get a better farewell or epilogue for her like Leia becoming a Jedi as trained by Luke, instead of a boring armchair general for this supposed rebellion. Why is Han Solo still a smuggler instead of a universally beloved hero like Luke should have been rather than a disappeared Jedi Master in hiding. People would know that Luke, Leia, and Han saved everyone before, surely?  Instead, this story does feel like an imitation of A New Hope from another Death Star, Darth Vader, and Empire figures. I really think The Force Awakens has endearing characters, exciting action, thoughtful character moments, intense lightsaber duels, and funny jokes. 

I just wish Rey was confirmed in The Force Awakens to be Luke's daughter or even Obi-Wan Kenobi because things get derailed so hard after The Force Awakens. Rey's parents did not need to be a mystery. Many things make no sense like how could The Empire return as The First Order with what funding? They have so many supporters, Storm Troopers, even a planet sized Death Star out of nowhere after the universe's balance was restored. It feels like they unwittingly undo Return of the Jedi's conclusion. Why are the good guys rebels instead of The First Order being smaller like just Snoke, Kylo Ren, The Knights of Ren, and a smaller army that are resisting the new government? Having the heroes be rebels for the sake of being rebels like in A New Hope is absurd after they already won and changed the galaxy. I really enjoyed The Force Awakens, but it ends up copying A New Hope pointlessly, instead of being brave and trying something new for Rey and her companions.

Harrison Ford is just a grumpy old man who doesn't want to be there. His Han Solo gets some nice emotional moments, but Ford looks dead from the neck up already at times. Mark Hamill is absent until the end in an absurdly dumb choice given he could have raised or trained Rey instead of using a legend of cinema like Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker to get people into movie theater seats. He's all I wanted to see and I ended up liking Rey a lot instead. Carrie Fisher is nice to see as Princess Leia, but she's just a dull General Leia here with nothing to do or say other than a quick reflective scene seeing Han Solo again. Fisher is just not as fierce or charming as Leia in The Force Awakens, but I'm glad she was there. Adam Driver is great as an evil scoundrel Sith wannabe named Kylo Ren. His scene with Han Solo is memorable, but I most liked when he was actually scary intimidating Rey in the torture sequences.

Daisy Ridley is lovely, endearing, and charming as Rey. I found her staff and lightsaber fights enthralling and her sweet sense of humor very playful. Ridley sounds so much like Keira Knightley in The Force Awakens. I guess Abrams wanted a new Padme, but as a Jedi. She did not need to be a great pilot or blaster shot. Rey could have been a natural lightsaber duellist and moral heroine with a pleasant personality. Unfortunately, after The Force Awakens, Daisy Ridley is wasted on a lackluster story for Rey. She is delightful here in every scene.

John Boyega is gripping, then annoying as a deserting Stormtrooper now going by Finn. He could have been a cool Jedi with that blue lightsaber or a fascinating portrayal of a Stormtrooper scarred by war. Instead he's a fakeout romantic interest and raving comedy relief like Poe. Oscar Isaac is charming and likable as Poe, but he gets very little to do or say. He's basically a comedy relief.

Lupita Nyong'o is wasted as Maz with hideous CGI instead of what could have been a cute wise puppet similar to Yoda. Nyong'o is a brilliant actress, so Disney really could not just put some make-up on Lupita? Andy Serkis sounds creepy as Supreme Leader Snoke, but does nothing and looks so bad with terribly dated CGI. Domhnall Gleeson is intimidating as General Hux with his terrifying space Nazi speech in front of The First Order's Stormtroopers. Too bad he's wasted overall with nothing to do but look smarmy. Anthony Daniels gets a couple of cute lines as C-3PO. Max von Sydow gets only a brief cameo when he should have played Snoke in a neat alien outfit instead of a random rebel informant.

Peter Mayhew gets a few nice moments as Chewbacca, but he's ultimately wasted. Gwendoline Christie does nothing as Captain Phasma. She exists to sell chrome Stormtrooper action figures and costumes. Simon Pegg plays the ugly merchant that gives Rey food rations in exchange for old antiques of value. He should have been a full puppet instead of ugly CGI for no reason. Ken Leung and Iko Uwais have funny cameos as space pirates. Michael Giacchino is Rogue One's composer and he cameos here as a Stormtrooper near Finn. Billie Lourd cameos as a rebel on the same base as her mother Carrie Fisher. Daniel Craig's Storm Trooper cameo is hilarious when Rey uses her Jedi Mind Trick. Bill Hader is a funny voice actor for Rey's adorable rolling droid BB-8.

Editors Maryann Brandon and Mary Jo Markey speed us through a new Star Wars adventure with a fast pace and an older feel. The Force Awakens is a long 136 minutes as the new Death Star finale fight with the rebels goes on way too long. Rick Carter and Darren Gilford's practical sets are cool with a gritty realism present in their ruined junkyard buildings and make-shift homes. All the numerous art directors illustrated where Star Wars could go visually from vast deserts to deep space and beyond. Lee Sandales' set decoration gives Rey's hollowed out AT-AT home all manner of knick-knacks that she's picked up along the way.

The Force Awakens has either astoundingly gorgeous visual effects like the ruins of the AT-AT or the forests Rey faces Kylo in the end or horrible CGI. Snoke and Maz look awfully cheap, ugly, and fake. I like how the starships look in flight, but they do get clustered together in the midst of battles into a blur you can barely follow. The lightsabers and blasters look incredible, but The First Order's new Death Star destroying planets looked cheap and you don't even care because we've gotten no time with these other planets. 

Composer John Williams writes a lovely score for Rey that sounds curious and romantic in tone. He never lost his musical touch and The Force Awakens sounds riveting with fearsome First Order thudding themes to that brilliant gentle Rey theme. The sound designers went wild with the loud throbbing blaster bolt stopped in midair by Kylo to his surging lightsaber noises. The lightsabers whirring by each others' heads are stellar. They get too nonchalant with The Wilhelm Screams everywhere though. Make-up artists Amanda Knight, Bill Corso, and Amy Byrne give Rey a lovely natural look for Daisy Ridley.

In all, The Force Awakens remains genuinely fun, if far too familiar a narrative compared to A New Hope."
"Very bad, nothing to do with the original canon 👎"
"Force awakens is and feels like a star wars film. Even tho it leads into the two worst Star Wars films ever made. This is still a good film. Disney is bad at their jobs."
"An interesting step back into the Stars Wars universe that ultimately ends up regurgitating A New Hope in an unnecessary way."
"The best of the sequels, overall good movie"
"Decent film. It spent too much time trying to be a remake of ""A New Hope""."
"Taking one of our all time favorite characters (Han Solo) and making him into a loser then killing him off is not okay. Also Rey is more capable than Han Solo and Kilo Rhen without any training."
"When we don't know how and can't invent it ourselves, we steal from those who can. It's almost a frame-by-frame reshoot of A New Hope. Well, thanks to this vile rodent who bought everything he could and ruined, also thanks to the main mediocrity - Kathleen Kennedy."
"The plot was a rehashed copy of episode 4. Laziest writing I have seen. What a waste of an opportunity. I refused to continue the trilogy after seeing this and hope a different production company purchases the rights to the franchise one day so I can give my old love a shot."
"Nothing at all here - it ruined SW, stay away or watch and replace every character with anyone else form the originals or Rogue One.  Fin is unnecessary at best. Ray  - really?  Been a farmgirl and then suddenly becomes ""The Force""? Doesn't work at all -  KK is a joke."
"All over the place. Just a huge disapointment."
"When thinking that the prequels was bad in the late 90s-early 2000s and then they butcher SW like this."
"No esta tan mala dejando de lado que la protagonista es una Mary sue"
"A movie which started with much potential for the new trilogy to addition to Star Wars. I liked it quite a bit."
"Remind me, why did Disney shrink a certain character on their China poster?  Hmmm?"
"While it looked good in some ways, the writing in this film set the series up for failure. Interesting characters were introduced only to be sidelined, the leads were given no nuance or interesting qualities, and it set up a plot that was true to neither it's predecessors nor successors."
"not great, not terrible"
"Really badly written story, huge plot holes and  a certain type of humor which has nothing to do with the real Star Wars (or the real Star War's humor) and overall just a total disappointment.  

Even If the actors are good, you can't do much in a movie if the story is so bad and carries such little deepness and originality within."
"Unoriginal but good."
"It can be good if you are blind and deaf"
"Don't pretend you didn't like this movie pre The Last Jedi!"
"The Force Awakens struggles to move the Star Wars saga forward in an interesting way. While evoking some of the feeling & look of the originals, it takes its entire plot from the original Star Wars- with almost no variations or new material. It plays it so safe, and is so derivative. At the same time the few bold choices it does make (killing Han), are done in an unsatisfying way. The acting is generally good, the original cast is fun to see again (although they don't do anything that interesting). Having our hero defeat the big bad in the first film, is a huge mistake. Kylo Ren loses much of his mystique and intimidating presence because of this. Rey's inexplicable talents & abilities without any training or character building is a poor setup for a trilogy where we are meant to be invested in the hero's struggle. It's hard to feel any sense of danger or stakes when the main character was able to destroy the main villain without reason or explanation. The Force awakens was a decent start, but it becomes retroactively worse after having seen 8 & 9. Most of the story threads introduced here are fully abandoned in 8, and then retconned back into existence for number 9."
"Great start to a new era! Well directed and well acted!"
"This had some potential, but the last jedi ruined this one too."
"the introduction of characters in this movie is really bad and the fact that rey does the force without significant training is really stupid"
"How to ruin a well established franchise"
"This movie didn't make any sense"
"At first glance this movie appears like it's right back to form for Star Wars. However with a deeper glance we see character assassination all over the place and a direct rip off of episode 4. There is nothing redeeming or good about this film and if I could give it a lower score I would."
"This is the movie that doomed the sequels. Regardless of what you think of the other two films, this set everything up for them to fail. 

Massive plot holes. Like how is the New Republic still fighting the Empire. Sorry, New Order.  Why is there resistance? Are they resisting the New Republic? No, then they are allied with the New Republic.  Why does the New Republic not have a massive fleet? How did the New Order carve out an even bigger superweapon and no one seemed to notice. Who are these people(ultimately most end up forgotten). Why is this a nearly beat-for-beat copy of A New Hope?  I literally rolled my eyes when they emulated the trench run. 

The reason this is the absolute worst Star Wars is that not only does it not pick up from where Return of the Jedi left off, it doesn't know what it is doing. And is too busy trying to pay fan service than actually tell a story.  The characters are flat and boring.  There are plot devices that don't make sense and are just never explained. Of you have Luke's lightsaber that everyone thought fell into a gas giant. Well, that's weird, but we're not even going to ask how you got it.  Because you're too busy trying to squeeze in as much nostalgia as possible and you don't have an actual answer for how you got it. 

Ultimately, like Star Trek before. Star Wars was forever damaged by poor nonsensical writing and no direction to the story.  And now all the content coming out after focuses on before the sequels because There is enough here to actually work with, and we have a clear timeline of how the galaxy is in the state it is, unlike this movie."
"I really miss the Pre-Disney Star Wars.  Please fire Kathleen Kennedy immediately."
"Not going to lie, I like the plot. BUT ONLY BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME AS A NEW HOPE. I will not give this movie a good review for being the same as another good film. Don't believe me? [A droid with crucial plans encounters a wide-eyed youth on a desert planet who happens to be force sensitive. This youth meets a mentor from the previous films only to lose him halfway through the movie. There's also a big evil empire with a big villain who works for a bigger villain fighting a small, weaker rebellion. The empire has some planet destroying weapon and is going to blow up the rebels but they stop them just in time. The villain is injured but not killed while trying to stop them. Later on the youth goes to learn about the force from a older, wiser mentor but he himself doesn't really do crap]. Finn was a missed opportunity for a stormtrooper Jedi and Rey was way too powerful for such limited experience. It took Like two years to pull of a weak force grab. Rey did it in a few weeks AND overpowered a trained force user. She also beat him in combat somehow."
"7.5/10

The best out of the sequel trilogy. I watched this movie in a 4D theater when I was in middle school, and I remember everything quite vividly. After watching it a few times, I could say that it is a pretty good movie. 
It had a few issues, but perhaps because it was the first in a trilogy, they could have improved some of errors over time (they did not). 
My major complaint is the main character. She is by definition a Ma-rey- Sue. She does not have much personality and wins at everything she does. Besides this, all the other characters were quite good."
"Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. No"
"Production was rushed, editing was poor, the film relies HEAVILY on special effects and nostalgia (vs storytelling), the main character has no character growth, and anything that resembles a plot was sacrificed in order to push a clear political agenda."
"In many places it feels just like a reboot of episode 4.
but after 10 years without movies it felt good to see something both new and familiar.

Sadly we saw how it went afterwards...

But the movie is still good by itself in my opinion"
"Bringing in two generations of the Star Wars saga, it has great chemistry, non stop action, and a memorable experience overall."
"Not bad it's pretty good movie"
"insert 10,000 rage filled bad words here."
"I really really enjoyed The Force Awakens! Was such a great start to a new chapter of Star Wars but unfortunately the two films after this one disappointed. The sequel films really could have been something great, it had such a great start."
"The best part of an awful trilogy"
"Decent start to the trilogy that could have been."
"The Force Awakens is a contentious, derived, unoriginal failure of cinema, and is one of the best examples of how to not make a film."
"Disney did well on this film good job!"
"This movie has a special place in my heart in that this was the first ever movie I remember seeing on theathers back in 2015 when I was 9. It completely rehashes A New Hope, sure, but they made lots of attempts to make it appealing. This really had the potential to perform a lot better, but it's still a good movie regardless. It just missed the mark in being an amazing Star Wars movie."
"One of the best starwars movies. The idea of finding luke was introduced right at the start, and the bad guys and there origin is put in the movie. And well we are getting the good guys origin in the movie but we all already know the resistances origin because of past movies. Great starwars movie for sure!"
"thanks for this valueavle information 
https://wonderwayimmigration.com/"
"Had its flaws but was still promising to bad the entire trilogy turned out to pure Skidene"
"Extremely safe but entertaining nonetheless. Star Wars is, in general, a wildly overrated franchise with the installments of actual quality being few and far between. A slightly above average entry here with strong performances from the old standbys and the fresh faces."
"Disney ruined Star Wars."
"Copy of a new hope. The whole resistance thing is a joke. How did the first order happen anyway."
"I remember when this movie came out in 2015. I was 14 years old and was extremely excited to be seeing the revival of the Star Wars saga. I loved this movie back then, and while that love has certainly waned over the past few years, I can't say this is a movie I don't enjoy. It has problems and tends to lean extra hard into the fanservice, but for a first movie in a trilogy, it does what it needs to do and doesn't overstay its welcome. It's definitely derivative from A New Hope, but far from a ""remake"" as some have taken to calling it. Sadly I can't help but find that the other films in the trilogy have retroactively made this one less enjoyable, knowing what comes after and how little is really set up here definitely leaves you wishing more of the trilogy was planned from the start, but on its own the movie gives an enjoyable experience."
"A ravishing reinventive piece of pure adventure escapism and a perfect blend of something fresh and familiar, the nostalgia feels are there but aren't the focus, the new characters are and the beginning of their journeys is so exciting in a past paced, visually stunning, emotionally effective space adventure that whilst is a homage of what we love, also does a lot of great world and character building that might be even more fun than before."
"Beautiful music & interesting characters. Very menacing villain, until the end.."
"A blatant copy of a new hope but worse."
"BEST FILM OF ALL TIME, as a massive Star Wars guy, this film was so special to me.  I will never forget when I saw it in the cinemas for the first time when I was 10.  I was just so absolutely obsessed with this movie, and I still am to this day.  I don't even care what anyone else says, this is peak Star Wars for me."
"This trilogy had so much potential. This is the only decent film in the Sequel Trilogy, but I still wouldn't recommend it considering how irredeemably awful the other two films are. That said, I can't hate this movie. It was the first Star Wars movie I ever saw in theaters when I was around 13, so I still feel a lot of attachment toward it."
"Meh,it passed the time. Now that's not quite how I would describe my viewing of the movie, but it understands the machinations of the mind it's very Shakespearean and Dickensian. A truly beautiful elegiac ode to its predecessors. It's a must watch but not worth revisiting. Conversely, it's truly special when viewed for a second time but beyond that I don't think it's like jaws or terminator. I think we are all blatantly aware that the lightsaber is a phallic symbol similarly to the broom in Harry Potter… geez Hollywood sure does like sexual perversion and it's made clear in this bizarre kafkaesque frighteningly dry plot."
"The Force Awakens has its fair share of flaws, such as the fact that it is a retread of the original Star Wars, the pacing makes for a really slow watch, and the dialogue is pretty forgettable. But the on the plus side, the acting is stellar, the visuals are striking, the action is fun, and the old characters that return are well utilized. 6.5/10"
"This was a great movie.  👍"
"Better than the prequels"
"Its kinda a copy of a new hope, but still a good origin story which is a mayor set up."
"This film had so much potential but it was unfortunately wasted because of bad character development. A fantastic example of this, is the character Kylo Ren. The Force Awakens feels similar to A New Hope (which I loved) in many ways but just with worse writing and much more boring characters. At the time of this film being released, this was the worst (and in my opinion) the only bad Star Wars film, but since the release of The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker, this film is good compared to them. Overall, this film isn't good and I wouldn't recommend it."
"Copied too much from A New Hope. Story is not unique nor original, and relies too much on nostalgia."
"Terrible! Terrible! Terrible!"
"If you ignore the plot holes, it's still a fun and entertaining movie"
"Since I was 8 I loved this movie back then up to when I was 4 to 10 I loved robots and droids and Hurid 327 the Loader droid was my favorite side character in this movie despite “it” not really getting and screen time then when the Lego Videogame came out of the movie I begged my dad for it and he got me the game. We played it together and I really enjoyed it, I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed the movie"
"I will always love star wars movies!"
"The Force Awakens is a good movie but takes advantage of fans' nostalgia too much. It is fun throughout, with intriguing new characters and good adaptations of the old, but it relies on previous movies too much. When this first came out, most saw it as a classic Star Wars adventure, and this is the case, because it is very similar to Star Wars (A New Hope). A good movie but lacks originality."
"A new triology that could have started better, honestly.
I don't praise him but I don't criticize him.
In a nutshell, it just entertains the viewer."
"To my surprise, I really liked this movie. Every character was pivotal to the main story. At times it felt like a copy-paste of New Hope with Starkiller Base and Kylo Ren. Other than that it gets the sequel trilogy off to a great start."
"a promising start to a disappointing, horribly written new trilogy"
"Just like 'A New Hope' but with a lot less life, a lot less spirit, and a lot more profit-hunting."
"Funny and romantic, LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The first of the sequel trilogy."
"Star Wars the Force Awakens is the 7th episode in the star wars saga created by George Lucas, this one directed by JJ Abrams of Cloverfield and Star Trek fame. This film is very fun and is essentially a rehash of the original star wars. Abrams takes the fundamental aspects of New Hope and repackages them for a new generation. Is not always a good thing since the film can sometimes feel like a reboot instead of a sequel. In here Daisy Ridley plays a girl named Rey who's been orphaned in a desert planet and joins the Resistance in their fight against the First Order, the successors to the Empire. Ridley does great as Rey giving her humanity and charm and we want to find out more about her. John Boyega as Finn has tremendous chemistry with Oscar Isaacs Poe but is really Adam Drivers as villain Kylo Ren who's the best here. His character is a young adult who's still feels like a teenager filled with rage and hatred. He is evil but we end up liking him not just for his beauty and driver is a phenomal actor exuding presence on the screen. The return of Harrison Ford as Han Solo is great and in many ways he carries the film with his snarkiness and charisma. In the end is a fun installment in the franchise although not very inventive or original."
"It had some promise but wow the acting, direction and story were bad."
"You can tell that Abrams loves Star Wars as much as the rest of us. I would place The Force Awakens in a tie for second best Star Wars movie with the original (Empire is the best, obviously). Abrams and his team really captured the Star Wars universe and stepped it up quite a bit, leaning heavily on real props, sets and locations (thank God) over CG whenever possible. There were more than a couple moments of sheer glee for Star Wars fans in this, including the Millennium Falcon reveal (the entire theater cheered; I literally had tears in my eyes). I wasn't sure there could be a droid more lovable than R2D2, but BB-8 just might be. The pacing is often as frantic as the original, and dialogue as sparse, but it works. All of the new heroes are well cast and likable (Jon Boyega is very reminiscent of Luke in A New Hope.., young, inexperienced and in over his head, Daisy Ridley is likable in her ordinariness and toughness, Isaac is a solid big brother / Han Solo type) and Adam Driver really does make the film as a conflicted and intriguing villain (all of the nuance and subtlety that was missing from the prequels)."
"This story line could have been done. Luke starting a school and having ben heading towards the darkside. where it goes wrong tho is that Luke isn't a jedi and doesn't fully believe their teaching. Thats why he chose to see the good in Anakin where Obi-one(the jedi) wanted Luke to kill his father. Luke would never even think about killing his own family because they're having dark thoughts. They medaphoricly killed Luke in this movie. Thats only apart of the back story. Good old mary sue is the main atraction. Normaly that word is used to often and in tern losses some of its merit but this time its 100% true. Some random out in the dessert can learn the force so much better than even anakin did. The chosen one, the one with the highest medacorine count, the one born from the force, etc.. He needed years of training but good old mary sue only need a weekend;I honestly don't know how long it was. The light saber fights are also shit. Kylo was taught by Luke but he swings his light saber like a baseball bat. Miss half trained mary sue fights this 'highly' trained now sith and just wins. I just can't with 7-9"
"I'll never forget the experience of watching this film in the cinema for the first time, a great film that brought nostalgia along with something new!"
"this movie brings nothing new, just a worse copy of A new hope. rey somehow beat kylo using the force even though she doesnt know shit about it and first time using a lights saber and she still wins, Han is a loser father and his character development was ruined. not enough r2d2."
"new set up of star wars, not bad at all"
"Insulting and embarrassing. Characters make nonsense decisions, Mary Sue protagonist, breaks every rule previously established in-universe, palpable blue-screen energy. Adam Driver is talented but don't let that fool you into thinking ""Ben Solo"" is a well-written character. For me at least the magic is gone from the franchise. Watching these new films, I just feel like I'm watching them drag a corpse around, refusing to allow it to rest."
"Familiar faces never grow old. The Force Awakens gives the audience a nostalgia that forever feels like a powerful reopening of what will be the start of the Sequel Trilogy."
"This movie's pretty good... Up until you remember that its existence is totally ruined by the subsequent films"
"Interesting start but get pretty disappointing. Gets worse the more times I've seen it. I don't recommend Ep 7 8 or 9."
"memberberry pie in the hands of corrupt buisness tyrant."
"Killed off a lot of characters to quickly. Jumped to star-killer base to quickly. Basically the movie was just a rush, and would have been better spread throughout the trilogy. A lot of things didn't feel original."
"We are clearly beyond caring what chauvinistic Star Wars male geeks may say; this is by far the superior, most compelling, most deeply emotional and best technically made Star Wars movie ever released. Wonderful characters, gripping dialogue, suggestive sensitivity, and a stunning visual spectacle: The Force Awakens is a feast for the senses and a treat for the inner child of any educated, contemporary audience member."
"It gets off as a well done star wars movie, only because it repeated a formula that is pretty darn good"
"The force awakens is a awesome movie that has the best charicter in all of star wars, Kylo Ren played by Adam Driver"
"Il remake di episodio 4 che gli anni 2010 meritavano. Daisy Ridley non solo è brava, ma è una bonazza con sentenza definitiva."
"Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'.

Despite seeing 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' around the time it first came out (maybe a little after), there was a long time of being put off by the vitriolic hate it's gotten here and the practical war zone there is in order to review it (even when it was critically acclaimed). Finally mustering the courage, count me in as somebody who loved 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens'. A masterpiece? No. Better than the prequels? Absolutely, and although some may disagree this is saying a lot. The best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi?' Yes.

'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is not the most original plot-wise. It has been criticised for being a re-hash of 'A New Hope', understandably. However, instead of being done in a cheap and slap-in-the-face way, it felt like an affectionate and nostalgic homage. Exemplified by bringing back major characters from the original trilogy in supporting roles. JJ Abrams, and this may be considered blasphemy, does a much better job here than he did with his 'Star Trek' reboot films, here he keeps the original spirit of the original trilogy intact while giving the film its own identity at the same time.

While it certainly dazzles in spectacle and action, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' doesn't feel too big, too noisy or too chaotic at the expense of creating memorable characters, a fun story and brains and heart. The characters are memorable with easily identifiable leads, the original trilogy characters bringing a lot of affectionate nostalgia and a well executed if not iconic (not by Darth Vader standards anyhow) villain in Kylo Ren (unpredictable and dangerous but feeling he is morally justified).

The story lacks originality but more than makes up for it in energy, non-stop heart-thumping thrills and excitement, generosity, a cheerfulness that is positively space operatic, vibrant charm and a few fresh twists along the way. In many ways it is a celebration of the universe while also an expansion of it. It is sometimes sentimental but never overly so, one crucial death scene is just heart-wrenching (particularly Chewbacca's reaction) and doesn't feel like a slap in the face to the character in question.

Could the villains have been better written? Ren is fine but Snoke only just about works as a character thanks to the visual effects and especially the powerfully enigmatic with a touch of vulnerability performance of Andy Serkis, other than that the character is underwritten. Also felt that Gwendoline Christie's character was unnecessary, so limited was her screen time.

Visually, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is a triumph. It is gorgeously shot and designed with Abrams' visual storytelling shining far more here than it has in other films he's done. The special effects are a dazzling marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films. Thank goodness that the dialogue contains little to none of the cheesiness heard in the prequels, and it even has more layers than that of the original trilogy.

Acting also shines, with winning charismatic performances from John Boyega and particularly Daisy Ridley. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher still have it, while Max Von Sydow shows himself to be a master of gestures and eye contact speaking louder than words. Adam Driver is a suitably menacing Ren and Serkis makes much of his somewhat underwritten character. Oscar Isaac gives a typically strong performance.

In conclusion, a great film, the best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi' and one of the best of the saga too. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"Good way to see Star Wars again, but very similar to the first one."
"I'm still a sucker for this one. I don't care if it's similar to the original."
"When I saw the trailer for the new star wars chapter I was a bit skeptical about how this product would evolve, but I was impressed to see a new storyline and new characters emphasized very well within the context. A bad guy and a good guy fighting something quite trivial I would say, but adding that air of space travel, combats and choreographies done well the result will be excellent, the only sore point are the various cabaret skits to make people laugh, I would have liked to skip them but at the cinema it is not possible"
"It was a nice karaoke version of episode 4, but it never got any better after that.  It would have been better if this project had never gotten off of the ground."
"Just a fan service copy of ep4. you can recognize all the scenes of ""a new hope"" and they are with the same cronological order and disposition too (death star/starkiller base appearence and firing. protagonist in a desert world meets a droid with a mission. the last battle. a looot of scenes and situations).
Enjoyable but not the masterpiece you are looking for in a saga of this level and after 15 years of waiting."
"I think if I lived in an alternate universe where Star Wars had never existed and this was the first movie I had ever seen, I may have enjoyed it - but I doubt it. I loved the prequels. Will never understand the hate they got. But the hate for this sequel trilogy I get completely. The story of Anakin, his rise and fall, will always be my favourite."
"At least they tried i guess? All around poor display of cinema. The special effects are good and that's it."
"""Let's throw out Lucas's notes and erase all of previously established Star Wars to remake the original without explaining anything."" - J.J. Abrams"
"No I am not a Russian bot or an extreme right winger and so there's no reason to ignore this review as woke media otherwise would want, my opinions are my own. It is actually possible to dislike this movie. Too much recycling from the original trilogy. Almost the same story all over again. And of course a whole pile of things that don't   make sense….wouldn't be new Star Wars without right? Must appeal to casual fans only seems to be a rule, but this one is still way better than the next installment, now that is a horrible woke comedy mess."
"it was  a good movie. and an okay remake of A new Hope.
was fun the first time i watched it, but as a Star Wars movie it did feel like alot was lacking."
"A young character on a desertplanet, who's searching for the sense of life, finding a cute little robot and a fatherfigur, escaping the planet wit the millenium falcon. The fatherfigur dies and in the end the Death Star geht's destroyed by a few X-Wings. I'm not talking about Star Wars: A new Hope, I'm talking about the new Disney movie which copied 95% of the fist Star Wars movier."
"Unfortunately, the film's protagonist is
Totally un-compelling since she possesses no discernible weakness or character flaw in any way. She is a better lightsaber fighter than a seasoned vet even tho she has never practiced. She is a better pilot than Poe Dameron despite lacking experience. She understand the mechanical nuances of the Millenium Falcon better than it's owner, Han Solo. Without any formal training she has become strong with the force… she is also selfless, bold, noble, caring, brave, and beyond talented at everything she tries her hand at…

She is un-relatable, uninspiring, predictable and so boring! Failure and growth through that failure are character experiences want to watch. Not air-brushed women trying to promote an agenda.

Movie is also an unoriginal rehash of A New Hope."
"Although I'm a fan of JJ Abrams, I think he had no business being involved with Star Wars. He likes two of the six pre-Disney SW films and is therefore not a fan. His dissipation was felt throughout the film. He and Kathleen Kennedy decided to disrespect existing fans by bastardizing everyone's hero's from the original trilogy. Moreover, their hatred for the prequels was a serious miscalculation. Gen Xers and Baby Boomers may not have liked the prequels, but an army of us younger people absolutely loved them. Lastly, this film was a copy of SW episode 4 with an SJW twist which revealed how out of touch these people are and revealed their lack of creativity. This film was awful."
"While this is far and away the best Sequel Trilogy movie, it sure as hell isn't good. It's a worse version of Episode 4: A New Hope with better graphics. The main Villain Kylo Ren has a very high intimidation factor up until around the 12 minute mark, where he is made fun of by his captive. Once he takes off his mask, all remaining ""scary"" factor is just GONE.  The new protagonist is a Mary Sue is every way. She defeats a Sith with years of Force training when she had never even held a lightsaber up to the point of the fight. She does unrealistic things according to her backstory, and is obviously loved by everyone. If you just want to turn your brain off go watch this movie."
"the beginning of the desaster, caused by cheap worldbuilding recreating episode 4"
"Can't for the life of me understand how people liked this movie. Sure it has it's moments and graphics are what you would expect from a mega budget movie, but characters are terrible (Kylo Ren has to be one of the most annoying and insipid ""villains"" of all time, Ray is just your generic Can-Do-No-Wrong-Strong-Female-Character™), mediocre script and plot, yeah..."
"Very cool movie, good humor and characters. Good introduction to the new trilogy"
"Disney played it too safe to allow any creativity. Still, I would have enjoyed watching it despite the strong feeling of deja vu due to its ""soft reboot"" nature if the macroscopic background made sense. As the 7th episode, worldbuilding was supposed to be the easier part of the writing. However, both the First Order (too powerful with no explanation) and the New Republic (only showed up + got wiped out in one scene) are so unconvincing that made it hard for me to invest in the movie."
"Just a big Middle finger to all the star wars fans…. Disapointment…."
"This is bad... scenario is a bad remake of original star wars... casting is awful."
"a great beginning to the new trilogy i recommend it"
"Completely ruined star wars for me."
"It would've been better if they created something more original rather than rehashing a bunch of ideas and plot points from the first film.  I don't understand how the director, writers, and producers thought it would be a great idea to do a near remake of A New Hope."
"I was really excited to watch this. The movie at least felt like Star Wars more so than the prequels. However, blowing up another essentially Death Star is so unimaginative. Kylo Ren would have been okay if they didn't make him an angsty teen. Finn seems like a pointless character. Dameron Poe is a good character."
"A lazy film that just redos a story we already had, no real character development and no real great character design."
"This film was a really nice introduction to a new era of Star Wars that also did a great job of paying tribute to the past. It had a great story, incredible action sequences (the opening is still one of my favorite ever), beautiful wide shots that gave me the same sense of wonder from the originals, and awesome characters (both new and old). 

I really wish Lucas and the Disney brass had trusted JJ to see this trilogy through. I think he would have done a much better job with the subsequent films than what we ended up getting....

I understand the criticism that this film is just a rehash of old bits, but I think it was just a transitional tribute that wouldn't have extended beyond episode 7. Also, I agree with what they did. I think it was really important, as the Star Wars franchise exchanged hands between Lucas and Disney, that Disney paid homage to the rich legacy that they were being entrusted with. 

Loved this film and just wish the trilogy overall had a singular voice, direction and vision..."
"This movie is horrible for a multitude of reasons, and I do not understand why it has a positive rating.  It borrowed so many poorly done concepts from prior Star Wars films and executed them even more poorly than the prior incarnations.  Why would you create a second death star that also has a ""big red button"" that you need to hit in order to destroy the thing?  And then, follow that movie up with a movie that explains why the original death star was destroyed so easily?  Should we expect a ""Rogue 2"" Star Wars film now that explains why The Force Awakens was stupid?"
"The Force Awakens is a decent start to a new Star  Wars trilogy. I think the practical effects crossed with CGI has worked wonderfully for the Star Wars universe. I'm a bit of a sucker for puppetry, so it's great to see it being used in Star Wars so well."
"The best of the sequels. Despite this, it wasn't amazing. It relied too much on nostalgia."
"Excelente reboot, fue una forma muy correcta de revivir la saga y continuar la historia después de tantos años, si bien se siente muy parecida al capitulo IV es muy fresca, el fan service es genial con las apariciones de los personajes de la saga original."
"wasted potential, both story and characters and I dread watching the rest of the sequel trilogy. The only redeeming quality of this movie are the visuals."
"Simple but gold. Star Wars fans hate Star Wars"
"A good start to the sequels but the other 2 movies kinda ruin it."
"A weak beginning to the next chapter, but not completely off the mark"
"O melhor filme já feito"
"Did a reasonable job of recreating the Star Wars universe but lacks imagination from a storyline perspective. Star killer base? Isn't that just a big Death Star?"
"Pathetic rehash of the original New Hope. Ruined Luke and Han, introduced a bunch of unlikable new characters."
"Very reminiscent of New Hope, and trading heavily on that nostalgia, but entertaining  good foundation for future movies. Flynn seems to be the standout character wise with so much potential, worried they may have set Rey up a little to strong at the start."
"A nostalgic sci-fi trip through glorious CGI, Force Awakens is both visually and emotionally compelling. It both stuns (killing off characters/places from prior stories) and copies (giant planet killer must be destroyed by a band of rebels). On a purely entertainment level, though, it satisfies."
"Off for a good start."
"a cheap copy of episode 4 but not great"
"This movie really was a love letter to the Original ""A New Hope"" Starwars, The story was nearly a one for one.

It had all the proper formulae for a good Starwars story.
Unknown characters coming together through a random series of events to save the universe from a galactic threat. Most of the characters were done quite well, I think the relationship between Poe and Finn was great, Rey and Finn also pretty good. Han and Rey was a little short and not the best. BB8 was a fun little character too.

Main short fallings in this movie were the villain Kylo Ren and the main Heroine Rey.

Kylo started the movie as an awesome looking enigmatic character similar to how Vader did in the original but then they revealed his identity. Then he just became an emotional wreck that got beaten by a not-even Jedi.

Rey seemed like Luke at first, a lot more enthusiastic about saving the universe which was a fresh change but then she just seemed too good at everything. She mastered every task first try and failed at nothing. She even beat a trained Jedi in single combat without a scratch. I understand that the force can help a lot but in the movie it didn't convey that well enough.

Perhaps this movie would have been better as a stand-alone without any sequels because on its own the good parts outweighed the bad. No way near the best Starwars movie, prequels included but certainly no the worst, other sequels included.

If I were to recommend watching the Starwars franchise I would suggest all the prior movies and just this one for the sequel trilogy. I wouldn't never recommend the two after this one as it would ruin any future projects for that person to watch."
"A million ways to ruin Lucas' legacy…"
"In retrospect, and after completing the sequel trilogy, this film is rendered mute."
"As close as you can get to making a remake without saying it's a remake or reboot. So many similarities to ""A New Hope"" that it is not a solid film by itself."
"""No words can describe my love towards Star Wars, this is the absolute sequel Star Wars fans deserved to have.""
Sorry, I'm not that kind of fan. 
Love Rogue One though, it's good."
"The magic is gone. Luke is an angry old man who almost murdered a child."
"Modernized retelling of the original film with less charme"
"F Disney!   You destroy everything you touch"
"Opened the sequel trilogy well, could have some improvement though."
"Many fans are sure to enjoy the callbacks to the original Star Wars film. However, to me, this was not done in an especially novel manner, which made it feel like a rehash of a better movie. I also did not enjoy the way in which the film took away much of the character development of fan-favorite returning characters."
"Here at the beginning, this sequel trilogy was amazingly done. Pretty much all the new characters seamlessly blend in and get us to root for them. An incredible moment in Star Wars history where it looked like we were going to be in good hands. This is going to end up a classic no doubt. If only they nailed it this good in the next 2 films. Boomers can hate on it because Rey used the force quickly, but that is not going to cancel out 2 hours of greatness. Cry about it old people. This is better than the prequels and a top 3 star wars film of all time. You'll see"
"While giving off very heavy A New Hope Vibes, TFA is able to not only give you a good feeling of nostalgia, but at the same time create something new with new characters and locations while helping setup a new trilogy that old fans and new fans can enjoy together"
"One of my favorite Star Wars films. Empire strikes back will probably be #1 on my list forever but this one makes the top 4 with ease."
"I had my hopes for this trilogy, and I was foolish to think Disney could keep the story from going into the dumpster."
"This is the first movie in a series of 3 that will leave you feeling ashamed to call yourself a star wars fan, a stars collector, or even be associated with the movie.  Best to move along, if you cared about the previous canon and history, you will not find them here."
"This movie feeds on the nostalgia of fans but doesn't do much but retell the same story as episodes IV and VI."
"Felt like a page for page remake of the original but with the added garbage of the modern times, it could've been redeemed in future movies but we all know how that went down"
"A movie that conforms to all the norms of today, avoiding anything remotely ""problematic"". Was making this film necessary? Probably not. Was there anything new or fresh in this film? Absolutely not. Is this just an okay film attempting to cash in on nostalgia from a series-long past its prime? Ooooh yeah."
"Unexpectedly decent reboot/remake of episodes VI and V...."
"Even though very identical to the original Star Wars movies it is still a very very entertaining movie and done very well!"
"Mediocre rehash of A New Hope. Passed a couple hours, and I thought it was alright. I have never watched it again though, so that probably speaks volumes."
"Saw this in theaters six years ago, it was cool"
"This film cannot be judged on its own merits, despite its apt initial presentation. It follows a decades-long canon (whose accomplishments it ignores) and sets up a potential buffet of intrigue (which its sequels ignore). Sadly, this film is an inescapable warning about what happens to good ideas when they aren’t laid bare. The Force Awakens is ultimately a failure because the questions it asks do not satisfy in their answers, and the sacrifices its heroes offer yield no future payoff. This could have been the best of the Star Wars movies. Instead, it is merely the best of the worst."
"Not the biggest Star War fan on earth but this continues the franchise. Wasn't horrible but has similar feel to the other Star Wars movies."
"Rating: 8/10. 85/100"
"Copy of a New Hope that doesn't pay off."
"I really enjoyed it when I first saw it in theaters. It's a little hard to go back to, now that I know where the story and characters end up. So I'm just rating it as I first saw it for now. until I change my mind."
"""The Force Awakens"" opens this new ""Star Wars"" trilogy to an entertaining start, with groundbreaking CGI and action sequences, this film is easily the best in the whole trilogy. The new characters and places introduced are not entirely fresh or memorable, though they fit well into the story. Speaking of the story, I thought that this film was heading in a very interesting direction by making Finn, a stormtrooper that betrays the First Order, learn the ways of the Force. I also liked the character Rey, though I don't think that she should've been the main focus of the film. Kylo Ren is a very well done and emotional character though, and his connection to Darth Vader adds all the more depth to his character. Where I think this film fails, however, is the constant fan service that is done, which isn't done in a very creative way, rather it seems more of a cheat for that extra ""Hey I recognize that"" moment. It often plays on the nostalgia of those that grew up with the previous films and uses that nostalgia to power its main story. However, all that aside, I still think that this is a pretty enjoyable film that isn't nearly as bad as some people will say."
"I hated the sequel trilogy with all my soul for a long time but then realised that as long as you just see these movies as a silly little story disney did just for some fun, that isnt seriously connected to the star wars saga, then theyre fairly enjoyable star wars films with cameos from the heroes from the origonal saga. 
Having Rey with absolutely no friends on a planet she grew up on is absolutely ubsurd and am amazed that it got the green light to be this way in the film."
"Copy of new hope. Decent start to the movie though, seemed like the characters would be fun and well written. Started off in a terrible time, exactly where the original trilogy started. Where was the New republic? Just skipped. Right back to empire and rebels."
"Molto molto molto bello"
"Let's just disrespect all of George Lucas's legacy! Horrible movie!"
"Top 3 Star Wars movie for me next to ESB and ROTS"
"This to me revitalized the Star Wars franchise again. As much as I adore the originals, the prequels for me were hard as hell to get through. The overacting or just plain wooden performances and overuse of CGI took me away from the magic of Star Wars. Only Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson were the saving grace of those films and the last battle between Anakin and Obi Wan. This movie breathed new life into the franchise by mixing the nostalgic characters we know and love with new characters who were fleshed out."
"I liked the Force Awakens, yes, it was a safe bet, but was enjoyable all the same."
"it was the worst scenario. the worst character creating, growing. the worst scripts. there was no link between any story or side stories in the film. It was also ruining the legacy of a very good Franchise. it was nearly completely against the mechanics of the Star wars before. It was also againts the mechanics that was intruduced in the film.  I was Worst tribute to real film since the Turkish  movie ""dünyayı kurtaran adam"" (english: the man who saves the earth) ( which also is somehow star wars inside) even DKA had better plot and was closer to star wars than this film. 

the music and visual effects were very good at movie. Acting was also over the average. but it didn't help to change my opinion that It was the worst ever movie that I have watched until I watched The Rise of Skywalker which also can be compared with Turkish  movie ""dünyayı kurtaran adam 2 ""  (english: the son of the man who saves the earth)"
"Should've been better. They nerfd Finn."
"aight, but absolutely trashes the star wars lore and logic"
"Un unnecessary retread of the first film that gets worse on repeat viewings, especially when you know what follows it!"
"Basically made the original movies redundant while rehashing the exact same plot from them with the death star like planet, scrapper from a desert planet finding their true calling. Nothing is original about this film and it's a shame when the star wars universe has so many stories waiting to be told. Not to mention they never had a story plan and eventual goal for a TRILOGY."
"Nothing will ever compare to the originals but this was the best Star Wars movie since the original. Well acted and fun to watch."
"Was an alright start to the trilogy but missed a lot of opportunities for character development and world building."
"It was the excate same plot as the New Hope. So everything the Rebels and Lukr, Leia, and Han did in the original triolgy was meaningless, because in this movie were right back at it again. In the same situation, the First Order (The Emipre) and the Resistance (The Rebels) are fighting and a poor person from a desert planet must become a Jedi and save the day. Sound fimilar? They could of done something different."
"Horrible. A movie that just raised questions that were never answered in the sequels, a screenplay that disrespected the legacy of Star Wars."
"Like so many, I very much enjoyed this first installment at the onset servral years ago,  and I forgave nearly all of its faults. But i now understand why ... there was still hope, and the amount of fan-baiting, nostalgia-clowning here is evident now. Of the three new ones, this has the most re-watchability by far, but given what comes next sours the entire experience, that's now lost as well. Three full films of galactically wasted potential, awful planning, and poor (sometimes ill-spirited) story-telling. The entire run is reduced to the tier of Star Wars Christmas Special .... forgettable at best, unforgiveable at worst. Star Wars by corporate committee."
"Classic recent film, all the moneys goes to cgi no money to the writers."
"The best one of the sequel trilogy, which is not saying much."
"It's okay, but the worst of the 9 Star Wars movies of the skywalker saga. It's just like episode 4 but they tried to make everything bigger.
Absolutely no innovation in the story-writing. Much cliché."
"The movie on its own merits is 3/5, but when viewed as a trilogy, its a FAIL, and viewing the movie as part of the whole Star Wars story, its a dull FAIL.

The best this movie offered me is it redeemed Episode 1-3. When will Hollywood get it that making committee-movies always produces generic, uncreative filler?"
"This movie feels like a soft remake of a new hope Disney was definitely playing it safe with this one after all it is the first star wars film in ten years So naturally it is jam packed with fan service and nostalgic refrences which make it the most tolerable of Disney's very lackluster sequel trilogy"
"Movie was a great opening for the new saga. Acting was great as well as comeback of old actors from past movies, also great special effects."
"fell short of expectations but it could have been worse"
"One of the worst Star Wars of all time:("
"👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
"Star Wars 7: The force awakens (A-) (90%)
Movie had so much hype before it's release and j.j. Abrams did a good job with it. Really wish that there was a more cohesive story throught the rest of the trilogy which ticks it down a bit now for me. But this movie and the other movies of the trilogy work better on their own then together. This movie in specific is just a whole lot of fun. Love seeing the rise of Kylo Ren (my favorite character from the sequels) and Harrison Ford back in action. Fun watch but don't get to attached to where the plot is taking the story in the other movies."
"Ok people Episode 4.1 is a good movie. 7/10"
"It was a good start off to the sequel trilogy....if only the other movies didn't ruin this"
"This was the first warning sign of things to come. Terrible"
"With fantastic action, familiar faces, and some great new characters. The movie set's the new trilogy perfectly with this movie that's just a joy to watch for all Star Wars Fans."
"Hey jj, they already did the Death Star

It was very unoriginal, basically created a villain out of thin air and needed way-way more backstory.

They just wanted to make an uncreative movie to make some money, which showed in the following 2 movies of the trilogy just as much, but was more recognized"
"Good start to the sequels"
"My favourite Star Wars movie I thought everything about it was perfect"
"This movie is not good. So in order to cleanse the bad taste left by this movie I will share a Delicious Katmer Recipe.Un, sıcak su ve tuzu derin bir kapta karıştırın.Kulak memesi yumuşaklığında bir hamur elde edene kadar yoğurun. Hamuru 8 parçaya ayırıp parçaların her birini güzelce yuvarlayın. Tezgahı ya da başka bir düz zemini bolca unlayarak hamurları tek tek açın. Tereyağını eritip hamurların üstlerine gezdirin. Hamurları dıştan içe doğru sararak rulolar yapın. Ruloları kendi etraflarında spiral olarak sarıp 10 dakika kadar dinlendirin. Dinlenen hamurları yeniden tabak büyüklüğünde açın. Tereyağını eritip içine suyu ve tuzu ekleyin. Yeniden donmaması için kısık ateşte bekletin. Hamurların her iki tarafını da yapışmaz tavada iyice pişirdikten sonra üzerine yağlı sudan sürün. Katmerleriniz hazır. Soğumadan servis yapın."
"this movie proves that it if you throw enough s**t at the wall, you'll have a wall covered in s**t"
"A perfectly average movie. What holds this movie back from being special is two things. The fact the movie refuses to do anything new and tries to recreate the original trilogy and the fact that every engaging plot point by JJ Abrams leads to nothing at all. This could've started off a pretty good trilogy if VIII and IX weren't so bad."
"A Great Start for the beginning of the sequels, with great characters, and excellent CGI, This star wars adventure is pretty good."
"While I do appreciate giving stormtroopers a face and making them more than just disposable enemies, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is an awful, despicable disaster that relies on nostalgia rather than good storytelling to engage audiences. For every one thing that makes sense, there are 100 things that don't, and it is clear that the movie was not very well-written. This movie also introduced the world to Rey - one of the blandest movie characters ever put to screen. This also marked the beginning of an era of Disney making pointless sequels, remakes and reboots.

Final rating: 57/100"
"I never would have thought this movie would has succeeded but it did. but the only reason why it does not have five stars is because they killed off Han Solo and that pissed me off."
"A well-paced J.J. Abrams spectacle that largely is a rehash of Episode 4's story beats. Not a spectacular cinematic achievement, but enjoyable nonetheless."

"Modestly entertaining. It's a carbon copy of the plot of episode IV."
"This is the worst film ever made in the history of cinema. Avoid at all costs."
"Cómo puede defenderse Finn (sin ningún tipo de entrenamiento previo) de Kylo (un maestro sith)? No tiene sentido, debió haberlo matado sin siquiera mirar."
"A beautiful but hollow film that is, at best, an overly slavish copy of A New Hope, and at worst, destroys all the victories and demeans all the struggles of the Original Trilogy to try and elevate the new characters into something like significance. A bad start to Disney's reign over Star Wars and sadly a sign of things to come."
"It's a fine start to the new trilogy."
"This movie had potential but they flushed it down the toilet."
"definitely the best out of the sequels by far. It makes out Kylo Ren to be a mysterious villain who Is very powerful in the force with him being part Skywalker and part Solo with him wanting to follow in his grandfather Darth Vaders footsteps. It also makes Finn a very interesting character."
"Star Wars The Force Awakens, is a great return of the Star Wars franchise and the characters that our grandparents or parents fell in love with as children or adults and after more than 30 years without seeing these characters and of course we all wanted to see this long-awaited return, although many say this is a copy of A New Hope, the truth was very necessary since not only Disney wanted to attract fans who were there since the first film but also new audiences who were also eager for new films, The new characters are a great strategy since we not only have to focus on the old characters but also on new ones who renew this franchise, focusing on each character, Finn is a character that makes me original in this franchise but at the same time Sometimes it makes me a cliché that has already become popular in the cinema someone who belonged to the bad guys who go to the good characters in a cliché that has already become very popular in addition As this character does not evolve very well in future Movies and it is just one more character, Poe is a very rare character who disappears very quickly in history and after escaping from the destroyer he no longer appears and when he appears you are left wondering: How did she survive ?, Although she makes me a more developed character in future Movies than Finn and the main character of this new story Rey, this character also makes me a clichéd character that in this movie you are created in great mystery among her that later they destroy in future Movies but the truth is that I make a copy of all the characters of the first trilogy, but hey these are not the only characters in the film if we don't also have Han Solo who is the first character to act of Apparition and that you really missed his charisma so much that when he dies it makes you very sad, Leia also has the charisma of the first three films, the villain Kylo Ren is another Dark Va der that the truth does not have as much power as Vader did, in conclusion The Force Awakens is a great movie and a great return of a franchise"
"Absolutely awful from start to finish. Not a hint of anything new. Just dragging old relics through the mud from start to finish. What is Star Wars without a skywalker. This has doomed the sequel trilogy."
"I hate how weak Kylo Ren is, but it's alright for a sequel episode"
"Firstly, this movie is mostly recycled themes and plot lines - essentially a rip-off of A New Hope. Secondly, the world building is atrocious. The audience isn't informed why things are happening, what happened to the post-Return of the Jedi world, and why the Star Wars galaxy looks the way it does now. There are some fresh ideas and some good chemistry between new characters.  Ultimately, it is only intriguing to the audience because of the numerous questions the movie leaves unanswered, conveniently leaving the heavy lifting to subsequent movies. It's treatment of Han Solo was quite disappointing also."
"Played it safe by essentially retelling Episode IV, now seeing how this story unfolds or rather doesn't its probably the best out the squeals...but that saying much."
"It is a Mary Sue movie sequel that reflects how decadent and culture less this society has become"
"It was better the first time
In 1977"
"What a Mess this was"
"Seen it all before and liked it a whole lot more when it was called A new hope.
So much potential and material to create something special...missed chance."
"Visual masterpiece.  Great character set-ups.  Too bad the trilogy never really gelled together."
"It was kinda average with lack of interesting characters 
Still being better than phantom menace of last jedi."
"Overall, The movie was pretty good when I saw it in theaters years ago, but now after seeing it after the sequel trilogy ended I can definitely see its flaws. It's such a disappointment that they set up the sequel trilogy so well with this movie as it brought a lot of potential to the franchise and new characters and concepts. But in the end, the sequel trilogy was wasted potential as the story, plot, and characters (besides Rey and Kylo) never really developed. Overall I'm hugely disappointed in the sequel trilogy and very sad to see what could've been..."
"The best of a terrible Trilogy... should never of happened. EU forever!"
"A remake of Episode 4, eh"
"A perfect movie to bring the Starwars saga back to modern era. Great Acting and perfect lead up to a small saga about it that ended perfectly"
"This was where the problems started. It is a soulless Disney corporate product. Completely unoriginal, basically a remake of a New Hope. It's clearly made by boomers who don't understand Star Wars, it shamelessly tap in on the OT nostalgia, while they completely ignore all the good things from the Prequels and Clone Wars. Disney had no actual plan for Star Wars, it's already clear here.
Only good things I can say is that it is more straightforward and entertaining than the two other Disney ""sequels""."
"I waited so long to see the Luke, Han and Leia reunion and Disney messed it up. Tried to remake episode 4, but the characters don't have the same chemistry."
"The Force Awakens had stunning and amazing visual effects and sound. The power of John Williams' music was amazing and contributed much to the film. However, the film was... okay by itself. The narrative was fine and story had legs to stand on. However with Episode VIII and Episode IX after it, the film is no longer as good as it once was. The Force Awakens also, nearly, completely copied A New Hope with the same type of planets, same weapon and stormtroopers. It's a fine movie but as a Star Wars fan, I cannot give this movie a 4 star rating."
"Not as bad as the other 2 Disney films, but that isn't saying much.  Still rotten."
"The Force Awakens was unique to say the least. The portrayals and star wars logic of this movie was lacking. Disney even admitted that this trilogy never had a real plan. A shame that Lucas never made his trilogy."
"A very enjoyable return to the franchise with dome interesting characters"
"Meh. A lukewarm attempt to add to the franchise. This felt clunky and ripped right from the old movies. I felt I was being pandered to."
"I'm gonna be honest here. Star Wars: Episode VII was the only reason why I started watching Star Wars in the first place. Since it was so popular ($2 billion, seriously? I thought Star Wars wasn't a thing anymore!), I decided to take a look at the franchise and seeing how the original and prequel trilogies were, I was expecting this movie to also be somewhere across those lines. Turns out it is nothing like them. First of all, let's get the praises done with. The CGI is awesome. With that said, let's move on to the bad stuff.

The story begins with a Stormtrooper named Finn deciding not to kill innocent people. First of all, what's with these new age space movies and concern for innocent people's lives? It happened in Star Trek (also directed by JJ Abrams, I think I'm seeing a pattern here), it happened in The Expanse and now it's happening here also. Star Wars is meant to be about fighting and killing. Concern for innocent people is exactly the opposite of what we come to watch a Star Wars movie for. And to add insult to the injury, that concern doesn't even stay for very long. Immediately Finn proceeds to kill every single Stormtrooper and escape from there.

After that there's Commander Po, and something something Finn wears his jacket. After some time the scene transitions to female Luke. Now I don't have any problem with a female Jedi, and I don't think anyone does for that matter. Ahsoka Tano was a good character. But when your character's entire personality is being female and having a plot armour because of it, then it goes a little too far. Especially considering a plot armour for being female comes when the character is actually very gorgeous because men normally have a thing for seeing hot girls fight, but Rey here has a very sister-like look. There's no way we would ever want her to win. Keep getting beaten, yes, but not win.

So anyway she teams up with BB-8, Po's droid and then they team up with Finn to find Po which they just happen to do so with some plot convenience. After that they join the resistance to fight the Empire led by Kylo Ren. He's literally the only likeable character in this entire movie (other than BB-8 probably because of the way he gave a thumbs-up with a lighter, it was very funny and cute). It's kinda sad that they ruined him in the next movie. Speaking of the next movie, they also ruined the part where Luke and Rey meet each other. I was expecting it to be a very big moment. Of course I won't be cutting any points from this movie for it, but it's not like the sequel wasn't already planned. They had already planned to play with the audience's emotions like this.

I can understand very well why there are so many people who hate the sequels. This movie looks like a complete rip-off of the original only making it worse in every aspect. Even I hate the fact that its poster does not look like a painting but rather a collage like every other Disney movie nowadays. I simply can't stand watching it again. Only the cool visuals were able to save it from being a train wreck that the next two movies turned out to be."
"Best Star Wars movie with outstanding storytelling and imaginative visuals and great action (though a little tame for PG-13 but still good action)

Star Wars Force Awakens stars Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, Harrison Ford and more, this fantastic bring back of the amazing sci-fi series in the 80's and early 2000's and this film somehow tops the original with fantastic performances, great action, well done story and lots of fun, my grade: A, Entertainment scale: 9.7"
"An incredible way to bring Star Wars back with having such spectacular action, beautiful and dazzling effects, and fabulous acting from both the old cast members and the new members, especially from Daisy Ridley who was the best in this whole film."
"Abrams managed to bring back the Skywalker story with a visually stunning and well acted film that is an enjoyable watch. It also establishes intriguing plot threads that would have been interesting if followed up in the next two films. 
Unfortunately, the script relies too heavily on the franchise's now well recognizable formula, and falls too much into nostalgia at times. 
6.5/10"
"Easily the best Star Wars movie. It has great characters, acting, and pacing. It's a huge step up from the prequels and even surpasses the originals."
"Decent nostalgia trip is campy but fun."
"Despite similarities to the original trilogy and maybe an odd creative decision here or there, this is definitely one of the best Star Wars films. Pacing, performances, action, et cetera. It's a darn good film."
"Eu fiquei chateado pela falta de criatividade na direção do filme. É uma boa introdução, claro, mas já vi fanfics mais originais. A Disney quis jogar seguro demais com esse filme, e praticamente reciclou cenas inteiras de outro. Não gostei da megalomania de destruir 5 planetas e não vejo necessidade narrativa uma vez que isso destruiria a economia galática, e o filme não da motivos pra entendermos porque isso se deu, tampouco o posterior que veio para ignorar esse.

Senti necessidade de tocar na trama política também, esse filme me pareceu uma tentativa de fazer algo genérico pra gerar dinheiro, contrasta muito com a originalidade dos filmes do George que o precederam, especialmente A Vingança dos Sith."
"a new hope, pero bien echa"
"Lame and unoriginal. It is sad that Hollywood is so blatantly profit driven that they feel the need to keep turning out sequels like this one. The dialogue, acting and plot were wooden and the films was PC for the sake of driving ticket sales. I wish they could retire this franchise because the original trilogy was great."
"""This will begin to make things right"" is the first line spoken in this movie... oh how wrong they were. This is basically just a retread of ""A New Hope"" and that really makes the movie, as a whole, not very rewatchable. Harrison Ford and Adam Driver carry this movie and I seriously love their characters (Kylo Ren is definitely the best character to come from the Sequels). I like this movie and I think it's good but it could've been much better. Nevertheless, a solid start to the new movies with the potential for greatness. Sadly things didn't go so well after this..."
"Nothing new here. Just a boring new cast and a rip off of the first Star Wars movies plot"
"Amazing CGI, amazing new cast, amazing story, and amazing comedy!"
"It was a tall order for a new Star Wars trilogy to live up to the expectations of the previous two trilogies. The Force Awakens did exactly that. We were introduced to some great characters and saddened by the loss of others. It was a great setup for the future of the saga but ultimately the best of the sequel trilogy."
"introduces more female leads into the star wars universe, and brings a fresh ominous feel to the dark side with the intro to snoke. The film also introduced a few new abilities used with the force and brings us the aftermath story of our heros from the original trilogy."
"It took no risks and kind of just repeated a new hope."
"It wasn't the worst of the new Star Wars movies, but it certainly wasn't good by any means."
"Não é o melhor filme das sequels, e longe de ser o melhor de Star Wars, porém é um filme incrível, um ótimo começo para a trilogia, minha única crítica é a falta de criatividade de J.J abrams em faze-lo."
"Like Episode I, I felt the excitement and thankfulness of having new Star Wars movies influenced my first opinion. No, its not as disappointing as any of the prequels but it isn't that strong of a film.  J.J. Abrams simply rehashed the original film as he did with the Star Trek films. He came into the film with a fan's love for the franchise but he also let us down in a few ways. But we didn't expect what was coming."
"The Force Awakens provides a brilliant plot that introduces old characters and new characters perfectly. The action is fantastic to watch, the CGI is very realistic, and the acting it great."
"Nostalgia bait for Star Wars lovers of the world, like me. I really enjoyed this story and the direction this franchise has taken for a new generation of fans. It looks amazing and introduces a wonderful mix of new and old characters for all to enjoy. 9/10"
"The Force Awakens is a space adventure set a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. My brother and I have watched this movie a few times at home when we are bored and need something to do so I understand the plot and ideas for this movie. The moving needs work on the originality. The plot is very much like the original trilogy, Rey the main character is an unlikely hero living on a barren planet, very similar to Luke Skywalker in the original trilogy.  Kylo Ren the antagonist has a resemblance to Darth Vader mostly in his suit and how he acts, these two characters are just like Luke and Vader, they have similar backstories, ideals, and goals; They lack any new depth. As the movie progresses Rey is approached by two fleeing characters, a rebel prisoner and a subordinate stormtrooper and together they make an unlikely team, much like Luke, Han Solo, and Leia Organa. Three different people working together to take out an empire. The next problem is the plot, the force awakens has a very similar plot to the original trilogy, a small ragtag band of rebels trying to take out the empire that wants to control the galaxy. Kylo Ren wants Rey to join him and rule the galaxy together. The First Order has a star killer base that is just a death star that is 10x bigger and covered in snow, but there is a weakness in its core and Rey, Finn, and Poe want to exploit it and save the day. Which they do and then they become heroes of the resistance. Also during this movie, Rey is searching for Luke Skywalker so he can train her in the ways of the force. This has a very similar feel when Luke is going to Dagoba to find Yoda so he can train as a Jedi after Obi-Wan Kenobi died on the first death star. If I could rate this movie I would give it a 3.5 because the movie was not terrible, the action was good, the characters are relatable. But on the other hand, the plot is unoriginal the characters are old characters tweaked a bit to look different. But there are lots of good parts of the movie, it is not all bad. There is a lot more to the movie that does make it unique."
"Star Wars: The Force Awakens begins with introducing a new character named Kylo Ren to us, I really liked the way they presented him to us, and showed us that he will be very important in this movie. We get to know another new character named Rey, she didn't felt special in the first scenes, but the first moment I liked her was when she meets BB8 for the first time, a really sweet and fun moment. Going on to two other new characters Poe & Finn, Finn seems like a really good guy from the first moment he lifts his helmet, but I was not the biggest fan of the escape, because I think it was way too easy for two guys to just flee and it was also very unspectacular. When Rey & Finn meet for the first time I thought the conversation was very bad-written and felt cringy, but this time I liked their escape. A lovely moment when we saw Han and Chewie back. During the middle of the movie, the story was a bit flat and sometimes boring, almost typical Star Wars, part of it because the storytelling just randomly getting slower. The ""first-order"" speech was incredibly well acted and well done in general. It felt weird to see both Finn and Rey dealing with the lightsaber that easily, remembering how much Luke for example struggled back in the day when he first had a lightsaber, was not a fan of it. Nostalgia kicked real hard when we saw Han and Leia together one more time. Rey getting to know her powers and mind battling Kylo Ren was badass and helped me liking and respecting her character more. Kylo killing Han immediately shows how huge his character can become in this universe, a huge moment. But then the writing begins to annoy me. Why doesn't Kylo just make sure Finn is dead? Why is Rey equally and in the end a better fighter with the lightsaber than the trained Kylo? Such a lazy, dumb plot in my opinion. Although the fights in themselves were great. Even though R2D2 is not a real thing in this movie, he somehow is once again the MVP, how ironic. In the end, I absolutely loved the wide camera shot showing Rey and Luke standing across from each other. Solid movie, with some lazy writing mistakes and logical mistakes."
"Good plot and argument as well as entertaining, but I definitely fail, it is a REMAKE OF A NEW HOPE, clearly where we want to see it is a new version of episode IV, apparently bringing the nostalgia of the originals they thought that many of us would not realize it, This installment failed to tell a new story to tell us what happened after the return of the Jedi."
"Definitely not on the same level as the originals, but so SO much better than the prequels. Its an energetic roller coaster ride that brings back the Star Wars sprit with a great new cast and some returning legends. There are some large flaws, but overall it's a highly enjoyable adventure. It's a shame the sequel had that director, and went that direction, and turned the fanbase into a toxic hatefest between the final two films in the franchise."
"A wonderful return to the world of Star Wars. Similar in plot to A New Hope, with more than enough to welcome a new generation of fans."
"Fresh and new but still true to the originals. Introduces a new set of characters and lays the groundwork for what had the potential to be an amazing trilogy."
"Bom filme, porém, por se tratar de um Star Wars, deixa a desejar, quando comparado ao padrão dos clássicos."
"While The Force Awakens is guilty of some of what I had feared going in, it also showed me enough of what I'd hoped for to get me excited about where the series was going. https://letterboxd.com/josephtomastik/film/star-wars-the-force-awakens/"
"Great sequel with a lot of great action sequenses, great new characters and intresting story."
"Mostly a modern rehash of Star Wars: A New Hope, but I was okay with most of the characters and new story threads in this first attempt at a new SW movie in decades.

It's a shame that pretty much all of the new characters and story lines ended up not paying off in The Last Jedi, and from what I understand, were attempted to be retconned and fixed in the sequel via damage control due to wide-spreading fan disappointment (still haven't see Rise of Skywalker and have no desire to after seeing The Last Jedi).

This is the first movie I fell asleep during while watching in a theater, upon my second viewing with a friend. That's when I realized this movie was just okay (similar to The Phantom Menace, when I liked it on first viewing but grew weary of it on subsequent viewings)."
"The Force Awakens is a fun and loyal film to the star wars series. It uses a format that is familiar in the original star wars film, but well executed. The movie introduces new characters and places them in a world that we all know and love. Characters like Leia and Han have their story continued and weaved into the new generation as well as we could hope. Very fun and safe movie."
"god as much as i hate jj abrams with a burning passion for the rise of skywalker, won't lie, this movie is fucking awesome."
"Nice re-hash of A New Hope. Good buildup for more films."
"es una gran pelicula, la mejor de la franquicia"
"Despite a giant budget, this movie brings nothing really new to the table in terms of Star Wars lore. Yes, the sequels were bad too, but here we have simply a remixed, poorer remake of Star Wars (known to fans as ""A New Hope"") with some callbacks to Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, but as if made by somebody who didn't really understand what made those movies beloved classics in the first place (some still say ROTJ isn't a classic but I'm not one of them). A very cookie cutter, by the numbers movie, that only took one slight ""risk"" in killing off a beloved character in a rather silly fashion. If you aren't already familiar with Star Wars, you might not have gotten why this was a big deal, but a lot of reviewers praised this one simply because George Lucas had nothing to do with it and because it was the first ""new"" Star Wars movie in about a decade. Be careful what you wish for. Honestly I would give those cheesy comic books and novels that chronicle the ""further adventures of..."" another chance in the Expanded Universe after this soulless garbage. Looking back there was some potential but struggling directors and weird corporate agendas doomed this ""new trilogy"" from the start."
"It was great. Predictable, but great nonetheless."
"After years of waiting we FINALLY!!! Got to jump back into the Star Wars franchise and I must say being a massive Star Wars fan from the beginning I was extremely disappointed in this film I didn't bond with any of the characters, and feel like the arch with Rey makes no sense, on her powers etc, when rejoining a franchise the film needs to feel old and new, however to me it feels like an old script changed a little made in the modern century extremely disappointed as I have been waiting for forever"
"The Force Awakens is a mindless shoot-em-up. The plot is rehash of Return of the Jedi which is a rehash of a New Hope. Disney took the Star Wars name and was able to make a quick buck while not having to invest in someone to write a good story."
"The experience to see this in theaters was amazing."
"A pretty good start to an overall disappointing Star Wars trilogy, movie stays entertaining all throughout but uses too many elements that were done more then once in the same franchise (starkiller base being deathstar #3)"
"loved it so much, awsome love it sooooooo much"
"I get that people say this is just a New Hope all over again, but I enjoyed it."
"Not bad, probably the best one out of the sequel trilogy"
"Best of the sequel trilogy, but they are all very bad movies. Terrible characters , cringe dialogue, horrible plot. Don't waste your time, this is made for people who are mentally 11 years old."
"It's a promising start to the new trilogy but is ultimately let down by its successors. Probably the best Star Wars movie apart from the original trilogy."
"This film is awesome. Brings back my loved for star wars. Sadly the stories were not handle well in the sequel but this film did the setup right and introduce new characters that i loved. Sadly also was not used well in the sequels."
"26.03.2021 ---------"
"Was unoriginal, felt like a better-looking rip-off of star wars a new hope and they just added new elements into the same storyline, but was intriguing and awesome to watch."
"The film is a fun watch, although it relies far too heavily on copying the original, and is woefully hindered by the subsequent movies."
"It's a really good movie yes it's basically a remake of a new hope but other then that I really enjoyed it."
"Compared to its predecessors: it is a pile of garbage."
"Han has reverted back to his old ways... so he's undone.
Leia, is a failure.
Luke is a failure and also a coward.
That's Disney Star Wars people."
"love Kylo Ren. Hate Ray. Yuck. Overall not a bad movie. Suspenseful."
"I've never been a big star wars fan but this film really changes everything for me, a unbelievably good start for the saga"
"It's not anything special, more like a repeat of A New Hope but it's solid and has potential."
"Not bad, they play on the feelings of the fans to create a product that works, nostalgia is a powerful ally."
"It has light sabers! That's all that Disney thinks Star Wars is about. Adam Drivers acting is the only positive in this lens flare of a dumpster fire. Beginning of the end of Star Wars."
"A bad copy of Episode 4. Birth of the Mary Sue that will destroy Star Wars."
"JJ Abrams gave us the perfect way to revive the Star Wars Franchise, a film filled with nostalgia of the Original Trilogy while introducing us to a Post-ROTJ Star Wars galaxy, visually impressive with great performances from the cast, especially Adam Driver."
"Brings back the thrills, warmth, excitement and organic visual style of classic Star Wars.  Love it."
"Awful up-scaled re-hashing of A New Hope, plot was messy and incoherent, the entire trilogy should have been about the aftermath of the emperors death, and the futures of Han, Luke, and Leia, but instead they used it ""reset"" then regurgitate the same story back at fans... totally disregarding the story of the original heroes... how insulting.

Still it was the best of the Sequel Trilogy Films."
"Very solid constructed movie. Yes it does have a very similar plot to A New Hope but it does do some stuff differently. It also has some very compelling and very well handled characters and was the best at starting a trilogy of the 3 Star Wars 1st movies of the trilogy. The visual effects here were finally where they needed to be for a Star Wars film and it was easy to follow and a very fun and nostalgic experience."
"A horrible way to start a new trilogy with beloved charters changing in their behavior and not properly introducing new characters as they should be . They introduce Rey a mary sue who is perfect at everything and has no arch throughout the rest of the trilogy. And the plot is a rehash of A new Hope with better technology but with worse characters and doesn't come up with new ideas or executes them horribly and they treat the OG characters in horrible ways. And the way they started Luke was terrible."
"THE WORST THING I HAVE SEEN !! They use nods to the movies to sell nostalgia, but they do it in an unnatural and super forced way, Ray turns out to be super powerful out of nowhere, I mean, he is a repnte nobody, they put a sabke on his hand and zaz defeats Kylo Ren , Darth Vader's grandson and Luke Skywalker's son, but how does he defeat him? Well, so nonsense! Nothing else because they did not know how to build and develop a character and only in 15 minutes of NOTHING AND WITHOUT DESERVING IT, it is already a master in strength and examples like these nonsensical abound in the plot, not to mention that there are mnton of garbage characters without chiate , filling that they are only there to comply with the minorities, honestly it is a movie that I would NEVER SEE AGAIN"
"A strong start to a new trilogy, interesting and diverse characters add to the richness of the Star Wars universe."
"The amazing follow up to return of the jedi that we needed"
"After the horrible prequel trilogy, Star Wars gets back on track with The Force Awakens.

Jam packed with action and visually stunning scenes; JJ Abrams does an incredible job bringing back the aura of the original trilogy with much needed new energy.

I had so much hype about this movie and it still exceeded my expectations."
"It's the first Star Wars film in many years (over 35), with the magic and optimism that A New Hope had.  JJ Abrams has found the perfect cast (almost), and created the perfect tone for the reset of the third trilogy.  If only he'd been in charge of the last trilogy."
"This one was good but not good enough."
"it copied a new hope a little too much, and they didn't develop Rey at all. She's a Mary Sue"
"As a kid who grew up with Star Wars and getting to experience the prequel‘s at a young age and loving them (at the time…) this film was exciting and nostalgic. It was an emotional roller coaster with so many moments of “yes” being exclaimed."
"This one was much better than some of the other Star Wars films. I liked the characters as much as the plot. Great movie."
"A welcome return to the world of Star Wars, with JJ Abrams providing a story pretty much identical with A New Hope but with different characters. BB-8 is just and annoying droid and nothing compared to C-3PO and R2-D2 who get very little screen time. Ben Solo is not a satisfying villain, coming across as a tantrum teenager."
"Just completely undoes everything that happened in the last six movies while blatantly copying everything from them. It also prevented us from getting a much more interesting sequel trilogy."
"The movie has a lot of strong moments. Previously known characters are well integrated. I also like the dynamic and mystery around the two new young main protagonists so far, who seem to build a counterforce to each other. Dialogues aren't always thought through though and sometimes, the motivation of certain actions is completely unclear. In these moments, the viewer almost has the impression as if something was cut out and they've just missed the last 5 minutes. Most likely, this is just plot armor and these dialogues and actions just reflect an idea of the writers that had to happen but no one thought how to show the viewer why these things had to happen. In the first part, the viewer might not be very annoyed by this, though, because it fits well into the overall mystery that the viewer might expect to be resolved in the future parts."
"The best of the sequel trilogy and it's still hot garbage. Bad story telling. Terrible rip off of a new hope. I could go on and on about how horrible and mind numbing this is. Kathleen Kennedy should be fired."
"Abrams rehashes all of the original trilogy in one movie, flying at hyperspeed. Sadly, he never explains what's actually happening, or why we should care - for example, who is Snoke? Where did the first order come from? etc. And as always, Abrams proves he's incapable of creating a plan for his story or living up to most of his promises he makes to the audience."
"Initially, I bought the hype. It felt ok.
Then I looked more at the film. The more I did, the less I liked it.
It really felt like a poor imitation of Episode IV with more plot holes and characters that either didn't develop much (Poe), didn't need to develop (Rei), or that took a step backwards from previous development (Han in particular)."
"No so great movie, but watchable, better then the two sequels, no new Star Wars movie for 20 years before this one, so this might be why so many lovet the first one in the trilogy."
"Poor quality reboot of a New Hope, with no new ideas other than revamped Stormtroopers, I was disappointed after seeing this new Star Wars movie but this was the high point for the Sequel Trilogy!!!"
"Packed with great actors and good diversity but sorely let down. By the direction and a screen play that ripped from episode 4. Shoukd have been much better"
"People think this movie is ok because they are wrong. This movie is Disney taking a dump on Star Wars."
"Viéndola por segunda vez es evidente percatarse de todos los fallos que tiene y la carencia de originalidad, acudiendo de nuevo a la estrella de la muerte a un imperio que toma la galaxia, dirigido por un anciano maligno que entrena a un nuevo darth vader en la fuerza y combate, uno que no tiene ni chispa ni carisma ni paso por la mitad de atrocidades que el original ni nunca le falto apoyo y amor de sus padres. Es imposible tomárselo enserio ademas que la principal fue capaz de derrotarlo sin nunca haber combatido antes en la vida y usar la fuerza muy bien a pesar de nunca haber recibido entrenamiento, la peor trilogía de la franquicia las pre cuelas son una obra de arte al lado de esta trilogía."
"I was good, but the sequel ruined this movie and all plots it developed. So, as a one movie stand, good! As a part of a trilogy, bad (but, less bad than it's sequels)."
"Good, but not awesome."
"This was a promising reawakening of Star Wars. If only the sequel trilogy had the gusto to match it."
"I want to forget this worthless movie."
"While it does rehash alot of the original film it managed to catch the nostalgia that audiences craved for so long."
"When I heard this was coming out, I was so exited. I was not disappointed when I watched it."
"This movie is so bad it makes me sick to think about.  Star Killer base, be scared kids!  Pathetic."
"An enjoyable beginning to the sequel trilogy!

'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' entertained me. It felt like a fresh direction for the overall franchise, which I guess is little surprise given George Lucas was not a major part of this. I actually didn't notice a great deal of difference, or at least as much as I thought there'd be given his exclusion.

I enjoyed seeing the new cast merge with the old trio, even if there are only small appearances from two of the latter. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are excellent additions, both give top performances - I will say I didn't sense major chemistry between the two, but I assume that'll come soon enough. Adam Driver, meanwhile, suits his role nicely.

Original trio Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill all feature, though - as alluded to - Ford is the only one that has a major part to play. Either way, it's cool seeing them back in the franchise.

Everything else about the film satisfied me, I'm not saying it's perfect - esp. the plot - but I found it perfectly fun to watch. For me, it's a strong start for this era of 'Star Wars'."
"Really wanted this series to be great. Started off so well."
"Brilliant visuals and a motivated, talented cast cannot overshadow the fact that this is a lazy, timid retelling of a story that already exists. There just is no point to it."
"Copying the first StarWars movies without the character development.
At least Luke was originally unsure, scared, as well a sometimes cocky all while being trained.  He made mistakes and even lost his hand.  Made you root for him all the way through. Could not wait for the next movies to see how he faired.
Rey goes from being a scrapper to being mentally more powerful than Kylo then proceeds to being pretty much invincible and all without training. Could care less about the next installment or about her as a character. I don't really think there is anything else to learn about her because she is already great for apparently no reason except the Force.    Too shallow for more than 1 star."
"Adequate plot with interesting new characters."
"Thought the movie was good, but it was very boring for Star Wars..."
"Movie is the worst; plot is recycled from episode 1 & 3 but way worse"
"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens is a very good Star Wars movie and it does a great job at setting up the Sequel Trilogy. The Force Awakens introduces good characters backed up with good actors, another great score by John Williams and, while similar to A New Hope in some aspects provides a decent story for the movie to tread along. All in all, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a good Star Wars movie and serves as a very good introduction to a new batch of characters and a new story."
"Movie should be dumped in the galactic reach shoot."
"It seems that JJ Abrams and Cathleen Kenedy have no skills in making something different. They just copied A New Hope and it's 100 times worst. The only original character is Finn but in the next movies they throw him out of the window."
"No. No, no, no. This movie just CAN´T be better rated than Episode V or VI."
"Felt like a re-hash of E4-Storylines. 
Kid without a (full) family from a desert planet finds out it's special after all.. don't mind the idea of another lost kid... but did it have to be with such plot armour and slap-in-my-face obvious parallels to the old movies? A little more subtlety would have done this movie some good."
"Probably the best of the Disney trilogy but that's really not saying much."
"I absolutely loved it! Finn shouted ""REYYYYY"" so loud that even I could hear it!"
"A lousy remake of A New Hope. This is not as bad as the other movies in the Sequel Trilogy but it is still very mediocre. Plus what they did to Han Solo was awful, they make him a loser divorced dad who comes back and gets killed by his own son. Overall not awful movie but its just bad."
"a mi no me gusto. no respeta la histoira de star wars creada por George Lucas."
"Love Star Wars, this film was, well quite forgettable."
"A fun film that brings back the greatness of the Original trilogy."
"The new characters (and actors) are really great and the first half of this movie is gold.
The second half does not bring a lot more to the story and characters (a new Death Star... really !?) with the exception of the interesting Rey/Kylo Ren scene in the snow forest."
"0.30 laughs/min. 

Decent start to the reboot, although it suffers from some shaky writing."
"Action packed movie with a Star Wars vibe. A lot of plotholes. No original story elements. Tries to be a copy of the original trilogy with a new cast. New characters are introduced, but lack development."
"It's a masterpiece! Love the plot and storyline although it was a bit like a new hope. It's beautiful! Kylo Ren is great!"
"A great way to revive the spirits of Star Wars fans around the world. This film introduces interesting characters such and gel them brilliantly with an already beloved cast from the original trilogy. The magic is back in the Star Wars universe."
"It was okay. Not great, not awful, just okay."
"George made the same movie a long time ago, but it was better."
"A garbage disgrace to Star Wars! How does this get 92% critically acclaimed? This was BULL SH*T."
"This is a reboot. It is not a continuation of the saga. The story is pretty much Episode 4 A New Hope. 
Every single character is wasted. The returning cast is treated like crap and used to try and prop up the new. And you can tell they had no idea in hell where this new trilogy was going to go as proven by the absolute crap that was released next.
If only Jon Favreau had been involved."
"Weird replacement of Star Wars characters with imposters in a Star Wars-ish setting."
"The Force Awakens is a very ""safe"" movie with which to start a new Star Wars trilogy. It is similar to A New Hope, which was the first movie in the original trilogy and it was also financially succesful and very well received, so it makes sense they have a lot of elements in common.

The Force Awakens is basically A New Hope, but with modern effects and new characters. And I love the new characters. Rey is a likable and charismatic protagonist. She's a scavanger on a desert planet, waiting for her parents to return. Kylo Ren is the ""new Darth Vader"" and I find him interesting. He worships Darth Vader and he's young, angry and brash. The way he stops a blaster shot is cool as hell. His red lightsaber is also unique. Finn is another interesting character. What's special about him is that he's initially a ""bad"" guy. He's a stormtrooper, but he defects and joins the good guys. And there are certain moments when his knowledge about the New Order comes in handy, so I thought that was very cool. The story itself is great. As I said earlier, it's similar to the story of A New Hope and I don't mind that. The big twist is that Kylo Ren kills his own father, Han Solo.

I'm a Star Wars fan and I enjoyed The Force Awakens. It's what I expected. I had fun watching it and I recommend it to every person who is interested in Sci-Fi movies with a dash of space magic."
"I like it quite well"
"Just horrible writing all the way through. Go watch Clone Wars instead.."
"A copy of the orinigal film. It fails to give enough screen time for the original characters and rushes to introduce a lot of new ones. However, the story works well and is a fun Star Wars film which passes the time."
"Jar Jar Abraham manages to make an exciting movie but probably should have gone another direction."
"Copied ep 4 a new hope
Rey is an awful character"
"bad writing overall the main character is just a mary sue"
"There is nothing special or original in this film. JJ Abraham's has moved on from killing captain kirk instead of Spock to making Starkiller base instead of a Death Star the First order instead of the Empire, and the Resistance instead of the Rebellion.  Thus is a rehash of A New Hope but with cheap underdeveloped characters featuring Luke Skywalker but as Rey the Mary Sue and Darth Vader Jr. (Whiney space brat Kyle Ren). This movie i think sets up some plot points to be explored in the future movies but, I don't think there's a plan in motion yet. If you're a Star Wars fan who hated the prequels maybe this could be the start of a truly good series that makes you re-fall in love with it. If you're a prequel fan it mag be the same. For me it was mediocre and I hope that when this trilogy is done we will look back on The Force Awakens as just that. An awakening of something really great that alone is tired amd groggy but becomes the best day ever."
"The more time passes, the more I dislike this movie, for multiple reasons:
1) It resets the Galaxy to the same state it was in during A New Hope. This set up the whole sequel trilogy to tell an unoriginal story derived from the original trilogy. This was a missed opportunity. A better writing team would have been able to tell a much more original story. 
2) Another consequence of resetting the galaxy is that it set up our favourite characters from the original trilogy to be miserable failures, which is depressing. Given that many fans watch Star Wars for escapism and fun, turning fan favourites into failures was a terrible creative decision.
3) Unfired Chekhov's guns. This film set up so many mysteries that were never fully answered by the sequel trilogy. How did the galaxy react to the First Order's destruction of the Hosnian system? Why did Luke leave a treasure map so that he could be found? Why did Rey experience visions when she held Anakin's lightsaber? How was the lightsaber found? Where did the first order get the manpower and resources to build it's fleet and Starkiller base? Why did Finn suddenly ""awaken"" from being a Stormtrooper? Was Finn force sensitive? How did Rey beat Kylo Ren when she had no Jedi training? How much of the galaxy did the First Order control, and why was the Resistance to the First Order so small? All of these unanswered questions were distracting, and made it difficult to fully engage with the film and enjoy the story."
"Copied episode 4, nothing new and could've been so much better."
"I loved the film, everything is really well crafted.

There is just something about it that makes it feel a bit empty in my opinion, like something's missing, but I just can't figure out what.
But I loved everything else, very entertaining.

My grade: B+"
"It by no means is perfect, and very close to being a copy and paste of the original film.  However, this film set up an interesting story which excites to see where the trilogy will go from there.  Unfortunately the next two films are horrible, so this as a stand alone is how I am grading it.  It is definitely worth watching once or twice."
"Star Wars: The Force Awakens in the eyes of many will never be a classic like the originals, but in my opinion is the highlight of the Skywalker saga."
"Disregarding its later installments, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is an okay movie. While the movie is too safe to be as extraordinary as the original trilogy, I still believe that it is worth checking out for any major fan of the Star Wars franchise interested in knowing what happened to the characters from the previous films."
"This is a carbonite copy of IV. Where's the originality? JJ has made a career of copying other movies."
"A top tier Star Wars film"
"A successful return to the saga. However, it suffers from copying the formula of the its previous installments."
"A decent copy of the original Star Wars movie with no interesting innovation. I admit that Daisy Ridley's, John Boyega's and Adam Driver's characters are intriguing. However, here they are totally unexploited. Script and acting are good, without the prequel's mistakes, but the plot is totally generic."
"The Force Awakens is a lot of fun. Bringing back Star Wars from the dead with great action and characters, with just enough well-earned fan-service to give us a good time. It's a safe movie, but that doesn't make it bad. It has a simplistic plot, that allows the writers to introduce us to a new cast of great characters, and pass the torch from the old characters to the new ones. A lot of love went into this movie and you can feel that. The relationships have a relatable feel to them. Even when the plot isn't the best the characters are there to keep you invested and on the edge of your seat. With plenty of emotional moments peppered throughout. This is a good movie and has set up this trilogy in a brilliant way. Well, done J.J. Abrams Star Wars is back!"
"Tries so hard not to offend fans of the original Star Wars that it ends up just remaking it beat for beat. That's not entirely a bad thing."
"This is a movie you can watch and enjoy. However, it aged terribly, with a completely recycled plot and manipulative nostalgia. It sets up a lot of things that never happen or pay off."
"When I watched the The Force Awakens, I thought the film was flawed, but I thought TLJ may answer some of the questions, especially as to why Rey (without training) was able to defeat a Trained Jedi/Sith in Kylo Ren. I was sorely disappointed.

As it stands the Force Awakens is an unbridled mess. 
-Rey is over powered - does things with no explanation.
-Poe is just a Solo clone
-Finn is totally wasted and seems to be a token black man
-Luke a failure who runs away
-Solo a dead beat dad that abandons his kids
-Leia seemed to lack her passion and for some unknown reason, instead of being at the centre of the New Republic, is leading a Rebel Alliance? Makes no sense.

I had such high hopes for this, but alas disappointed."
"Was so great for the first half of the movie. Kilo was looking to be the best villain we had seen yet... Then he took of his helmet and just whined and sucked at fighting so bad that even someone who just picked up a lightsaber could stand toe to toe with him. Even Luke had to train in the original trilogy but they just give abilities to Rey without her having to learn them.
This film undid all of the great world building of all its former films."
"Good movie, but it sounds too much like a copy of Episode IV: A New Hope"
"It was cool to see some great action again in the Star Wars Cannon; however, this was just copy cat of the sequels. No creativity."
"Opens a lot of plot holes, the protagonist is a Mary Sue which is probably the most hated thing in the film. Without any jedi training Rey manages to defeat a force user from the Skywalker blood line who has trained his whole life. And I fcking despise how she can use mind control without even knowing about it let along training for it."
"One of the worst star wars movie. No plot, no logical characters. Rey, finn, and Poe are super annoying. they destroyed han and leia relationship. Kylo is this dumb Darth Vader wannabe who kills his own father. This just feels like a Walmart new hope remake with crap characters."
"It was just incredible to watch again the Star Wars fan fare at the big screen (I must admit that I cried a little bit). My expectations for this film were HUGE and at the end, I just felt that this movie is more a remake of ""A New Hope"" than a continuation. Is like a Star Wars knockoff with the epic return of our favorite characters from a galaxy far far away..."
"It wasn't very good. 👎🏻👎🏻"
"Han Solo makes the switch to the new Trilogy - an awesome feat!"
"Rehashed episode 4 shot by shot. It's a rip off and should be erased from canon continuity."
"Just a bunch of meh."
"Starkiller base is the dumbest thing in all of fiction and Rey is a Mary sue wish fulfillment plug in that doesn't belong in anything  ever claiming to be storytelling"
"I made an account to throw my voice against the hurricane of praise for this garbage can of a film. It was, and did not try to be, anything. It was just A New Hope with worse characters (the only exception being Finn. If they had done something with his character, they might have saved the trilogy) and substantially worse storytelling. The theming was almost nonexistent and it didn't even try to be compelling. If anyone hasn't already seen it, save yourself some time and avoid the whole trilogy"
"This trilogy is non-canon period. Closely watching the mandalorian now where luke actually has a good comeback despite it being cgi/deepfaked"
"luke : talent without training in nothing 
rey : what the fuck did you say"
"My favorite Star Wars movie, action packed with a great story. Must watch 10/10 ""may the force be with you"""
"As director J.J. Abrams points out, the ""Force Awakens"" is ""this great long drumroll"" up to this humongous climax which anybody could have seen coming."
"Pretty good! Too bad The Last Jedi ruined it:("
"I do understand that we need nostalgic scenes if the franchise is revived, but the whole movie as a nostalgia? come on ! you had luke-rey from same backstory, a relative as darth vader-kylo ren, even the droids has the same beginning R2-D2 and BB-8 and to top it off Death Star-Star Killer. Director-Had no ideas of your own did you?"
"Exciting re-entry into the Star Wars universe with promisingly interesting young characters and all the benefits of modern CGI. When one takes a step back, however, the plot is almost a paint by numbers of Episode IV. Nonetheless, it is good escapism and inspires optimism for the rest of the trilogy."
"Almost a shot for shot remake of a new hope."
"It's a remake of sorts of the first Star Wars movie. Quite enjoyable, mainly due to Harrison Ford. But it neither does make justice to the originals nor it delivers interesting new characters or storylines, as lazy and superficial writing is disguised by a fast paced direction. It even fails when it creates a quite promising concept - like a defecting stormtrooper - which is very poorly developed."
"The reason all of ""toxic fans"" are rude to sequel fans is bc they care about the franchise and they want Disney to make Star Wars good and if they get the majority of fans to hate on the sequels then perhaps Disney won't make those mistakes again and the newer Star Wars just wasn't good story telling or world building and to top it off they made Rey the ""chosen one"" which rendered the first 6 movies pointless when the first 6 movies were about the rise, fall, and redemption of the chosen one Anakin Skywalker 

With all of that being said it's still not a good excuse to be rude to people with a different opinion then yours but I just want good Star Wars and to me the sequels didn't hit the spot...mando tho 👀"
"the movie follows the line of the forth starwars movie, the fight between kylo and rey is a lot unfair, seeing for the point of view that ben solo treined for all his life and rey, at the beginning of the film, didn't even know that the jedis were real, but still, she defets him."
"It's called Star Wars, but it's not 'Star Wars'."
"Flawed from start to finish. Just like Phantom Menace, I really wanted to like this, but from its copy cat plot to its nostalgic pandering, and it's ultimate blunder the JJ Abrams mystery box that has nothing inside (lazy lazy lazy)(what a hack). I have no least favorite this whole trilogy is a travesty, because it wastes such potential and spits on generations who have a genuine love for Star Wars."
"Full of cliches and plot holes, had promise, now with Boyega confirming the distasteful direction, it has lost much of it's luster....."
"Best of the worst movies to come out"
"A fine attempt to jumpstart the franchise for a new generation. It wasn't going to be a classic but it set up many plotlines for a potential sequel to play with. A shame that the sequel that followed (The Last Jedi) discarded everything this built and doomed the sequel trilogy."
"The only good movie out of the sequels — some shocking moments and exciting foreshadowing. While the reliance on previous works is obvious, it still manages to stand on its own."
"I watched it. It had great return of the characters from original trilogy and new characters arrived."
"The biggining of the end for the Star Wars franchise... this episode 7 is a terrible rip off episode 4, but even worse, disney manage to f*** up an entire cash universe for them and dream forfans, making the horrible mistake of not putting together the old team back luke, han, princess leia, lando and chewie in the milenium falcon. Huge mistake among huge others..."
"At first viewing, The Force Awakens is a hard pill to swallow. It is Disney's showcase into one of the greatest film franchises ever, and honestly, it's pretty good. It establishes another set of lovable characters for the franchise. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac play characters that are very easy to get behind. The movie establishes them in the usual Star Wars archetypes. Poe Dameron (Isaac) the very heady freedom fighter. Finn (Boyega) the redeemed first order soldier with a new outlook on the war at hand. Finally Rey (Ridley) the orphaned scavenger who finds her way into a galactic conflict. It also brings back the ""OGs"" of the franchise in Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford as they reprise their roles as the Princess and the Scoundrel. Adam Driver (Kylo Ren), Gwendoline Christie (Captain Phasma), and Domhnall Gleeson (General Hux) prove to be a formidable group of enemies for the new resistance. There is plenty of action and Abrams quality effects. The story seems repetitive of A New Hope, but it still works. This is a good movie to welcome a new generation into the world of Star Wars."
"A boring rehash that spawned a terrible uninteresting trilogy. Of course disney controls RT so you'll never see this movie below 86 percent just like ROTS"
"interesting movie, the characters is ok. Enjoyable and the only good movie in the sequel trilogy"
"The beginning of the end for star wars."
"The film's characters were pretty well rounded, with most growing into something different by the end.
  Harrison Ford's character, Han Solo, evolves from being completely unconcerned about his odd ball family to
  becoming deeply committed. However, the character Rey, Played by Daisy Ridley, was woefully underdeveloped, with
  no clear evolutionary arc. That said, overall the characters were more engaging than those in the original Star Wars."
"Neutral sequel casually introduces our new heros."
"I gave it a pass at first because it had potential, but The Rise of Skywalker makes this movie look so much worse in hindsight since now we know that nothing that occurs in this movie matters and it is only marginally entertaining on its own."
"Is a copy of A New Hope..."
"It didn't quite get the satisfying payoffs that it set up in the next two movies, but taking it as its own movie without thinking of the others it's still a highly entertaining return to the Star Wars franchise."
"The first film of the new trilogy introduced some cool new characters, and leaves you hyped to see how the rest will play out. Exactly what the first film should do. John Boyega and Adam Driver are perfect for their roles (Finn and Kylo, respectively). Unfortunately, the rest of the trilogy is absolute garbage, and doesn't do anything with what The Force Awakens set up. Such a shame."
"Sadly because this becomes part of the dumpster fire that occurs in the two sequel movies after this I have to give this two stars.   The two stars is because another death star retread is stupid and the dumpster fires that followed this movied ruined all the intrigue this movie created."
"I liked it better when they made this same exact movie the first time in 1979. It's called ""Star Wars."" Also, who decided eternal goofball Adam Driver was the next Darth Vader? Lazy."
"A cautiously written action-packed adventure that brings a new hope to the Star Wars universe."
"It plays on nostalgia but in the end it is just the same story rehashed. It's quite unfortunate because I quite enjoyed the way both Rey and Kylo Ren were introduced. The first scenes of both were actually promising but then it was mostly downhill from there. The ""we need to fight the Death Star but bigger once more"" was just lazy writing. The movie had some nice ideas like the Knights of Ren that went completely unexplored in the saga. I didn't seem they knew where they were going or had any clue what to do."
"While some characters and decisions lack depth and reason, familiar faces and thrilling action provide an acceptable return to the franchise."
"best of the sequel trilogy (although that isn't exactly hard), but rips off %90 of its plot from A New Hope."
"A refreshing and modern take on a story told all across the galaxy."
"It’s very fast and action packed great story too"
"The wait would be really for the anthology series not this kind of awful movies."
"If you are a fan of A New Hope you will have a passing interest in this film because it is nearly the same story, it is the flea market version of the original film with characters tweaked enough to avoid litigation. This is the brain child of people who watched Star Wars once and thought they understood why it was good"
"Technically they CTRL C , CTRL V the whole movie from ‘A new hope'. That's where we should have known this sequel trilogy has no hope."
"I'm not much of a Star Wars fan, nor do I especially believe that God has a good side and a bad side, and it is best to stay on his good side. I've only seen the beginning of this one, again, lately. Is it the police force that awakens? Doi."
"It`s the best ""New Hope"" remake out there. Of course it fails to live up to the original. But everything ist pretty solid, unlike TLJ and TROS."
"Evrybody needs to watch this awesome movie"
"Entering a new age of Star Wars was almost an impossible task, luckily this new franchise relievers the Charm of the original trilogy. Our cast old and new come back to continue this classic legacy. JJ Abrams (Director) creates a beautiful film with magic only Star Wars films can possess. The acting is well done, the excitement factor explodes off the screen and the score gives chills from the classic original score. This film does run beat for beat of the original film, but adds a freshness and nostalgia to make it right."
"An utter disappointment. The story is worthless, mindlessly repeats stuff from episode IV not adding anything valuable."
"Wasted the potential of established famous star wars characters. Constantly breaking established Star Wars canon. Cringy, uncreative story and character designing. Constant dumb illogical mistakes that take you out of immersion. Just Disney milking."
"Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, showstopper, spectacular! Now if you'd excuse me *Re-starts movie for the 56th time*"
"A decent and exciting watch, but was a poorly executed mirror image of A New Hope. Don't understand the hype."
"Amazing STAR WARS movie, loved it!"
"A really great return to the franchise. More in your face action."
"STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS may take many plot threads from EPISODE IV, but tells a fantastic story that reboots the franchise."
"La unica pelicula de las nuevas que se salva."
"I have a lot of opinions on different remakes of classic films and I usually have more respect for the ones that have a significantly changed plot. The Force Awakens has almost the expect same plot structure as A New Hope. Think about it, the main character lives on a dessert planet with a speeder and escapes the planet via the millennium falcon, receives key information from a droid, and ends up becoming a Jedi, enters a shady bar full of strange creatures & music, the main villain wear's all black, has a scary mask with a red lightsaber and a bad temper, the main characters sneak onto a spherical shaped planet killing weapon to disable the shields so X-wings can blow up a week spot that will destroy the entire station. The Force Awakens banks completely on A New Hope for its plot along with its financial & critic success which of course it was. I know absolutely no one will agree with me but in my opinion this is the weakest entry in the Star Wars saga and a rotten 2/10 film!"
"Derivative of the original Star Wars, poorly written, incoherent, schizophrenic and trashes decades of Star Wars lore. 
A dumpster fire of a movie that I wish had never been created."
"Very pretty and complete rubbish. You've got to love star destoryers.  They are great any time, but seriously they could have afforded some writers who were older than 3 years old.
This story was just a complete rehash of the original and classic, only made incredibly stupid"
"""The Force Awakens"" how eagerly have I waited to watch you just to be let down by lazy writing. yes, It looks great but it's just plain ridiculous at certain parts not to mention the over-top ""order"" which apparently there's a 1st and a last of but nothing in between. it does little to explain the greater narrative of the galaxy. it's a very narrow perspective where everything fits regardless of it making sense.
and the characters... offfff, that movie is rotten."
"The Force Awakens, like the following two movies of the sequel trilogy, but to a caricatural extent, is a patchwork of ideas, scenes and characters that formed the heart of the original Star Wars movies. Additional key elements of the plot, like the conflicted story of the Organa-Solo children, are likely inspired by the novels. There is no script creativity, no inventiveness within the universe: we are served the old ships and planets alongside new characters that are shallow, as is their entire journey. In spite of an obvious attempt to tell a human story amidst the fireworks, the metaphorical and philosophical grounding that used to be the basis of the Star Wars mythology seems forever lost to a superficial kind of entertainment in which the hero bathes in pride and self-sufficiency and where nothing is ever at stake."
"This is a very entertaining movie if you just watch and turn your brain off. But, the plot is unoriginal, it asks a lot of interesting questions that it has no answer to, and does several disservices to previous entries in the franchise."
"Brought some interesting characters and plot points to the table but plays things way too safe and ends up blatantly copying the plot of A New Hope in the bigger picture."
"To the disdain of my close friends, Force Awakens was the first SW movie I saw (I know, sacreligious). After seeing it, though, I liked it enough to binge the originals. It's both a really good SW movie and just a really good movie. The fans that rate it lowly surprise me. I think they'd enjoy it more if the unnamed idiot hadn't ruined the trilogy with Last Jedi because the plots and characters would've been more furthered and built-up. This trilogy had potential to be so great. One of cinema's great disappointments. Alone, though, TFA is very good."
"Hilarious humor that feels like a Star Wars movie! I love The Last Jedi, but the humor was out of place. It was undeniably funny, however, it may have been a little too much. It was a little boring for the first half, but that's fine. It introduced Han freaking Solo back into the mix! Anyway, love this movie, 9/10, thanks for coming to my TED Talk. Good movie."
"Supreme acting by the newbies and superb direction by J.J.Abrams. One of the best"
"Buen inicio para la nueva trilogía, ambos personajes protagónicos excelentes, buenos efectos tanto los de cgi como los clásicos que le dan el misticismo de la primera trilogía. La historia principal para Rey llevará al fanático a buscar su origen y a Kylo a entenderlo."
"Rebooting the Star Wars franchise was a very difficult task. The Star Wars franchise has a long history with many movies, film theories, controversies, and a very loyal fanbase (which I am an active member of); Star Wars has been around since the 1970s so this is not at all shocking. Because of this long and complicated history, as well as a mega fan base to impress, Abrams had his work cut out for him when he took on The Force Awakens; he did not disappoint.

One of the reasons The Force Awakens is so successful is its use of special effects. Abrams and the production team went back to Star Wars' original roots of hand built sets, special effects makeup, models, and animatronics. It is these fabricated elements that made the original Star Wars trilogy feel so real and tangible. The special effects used in the original trilogy made the impossible world of Star Wars feel grounded in reality. We feel we know the characters of this world and that they exist in real places. R2-D2 and C-3PO for example, are full of life because they were crafted from hand and brought to life by the actions of real people. The ships in Star Wars were hand-built models and props that the actors could physically interact with. Matte paintings and moveable models created believable and fantastical environments. This use of fabrication is the main reason the special effects of the original Star Wars trilogy holds up to this day. 

With today's advancements in CGI it would have been easy to rely on CGI for the creation of this movie; the computer graphics would have looked a lot better than the prequels too. But the creators of The Force Awakens took the time to hand build sets and fabricate characters through animatronics and costume, which made all the difference. The scene where our main characters venture into Maz's Cantina is a great example of this. This scene is filled with a mix of both fabricated and CGI characters; very similar to Mos Eisley Cantina from A New Hope. This is why The Force Awakens is so successful. The movie sends us back to the nostalgic days of Star Wars, and we are able to connect once again to the characters and places of Star Wars through its materiality. Of course, there is a lot of CGI involved in making the film as well, but it is artfully intermingled with special effects makeup, fabricated creatures, and sets; a wonderful blend of old and new. 

The Force Awakens would not have been able to hold its own in the Star Wars franchise without the original movie scores of John Williams. The special effects of the original trilogy made Star Wars believable visually, but the music of John Williams made us believe the stories emotionally. John Williams brought the world of Star Wars fully to life. We know the characters of star wars through their musical motifs as much as we do their costumes and mannerisms. These musical motifs are what helps us identify these characters and further connect with them. When I think of Luke Skywalker I can't help but think of ""Binary Sunset,"" or The Imperial March when Vader comes to mind. Williams made a whole new soundtrack for The Force Awakens and these powerful scores bring the characters and world of this movie to life. Rey's Theme in The Force Awakens is extremely well done, and lets us know much that we need to know about her character; she's lost, but strong and hopeful. 

Overall, it is JJ's reverence for, and acknowledgment of the original Star Wars films that made The Force Awakens a successful movie. Long-time Star Wars fans can enjoy it for nostalgia and story building, and newcomers can become enamored by the wonderous world of Star Wars. The Force Awakens is a great jumping off point for this new era of Star Wars films."
"grwat ster wurs moviw ')"
"Why does this movie have good reviews it's terrible."
"This part is completely different than previous ones, but i liked it a lot."
"It was great!! The scenes were shot beautifully, and the new characters were really fun!!! Admittedly, the plot is really similar to the ANH, but I think that these new characters can really go places. The film was really fun to watch. I think that Finn's character is really interesting, and will make an extremely compelling protagonist. The new villains are also really interesting, and I hope to see more of them."
"EASILY the best of the Disney sequels. The new characters are interesting and relatable, old members of the cast return for even more fun, the visuals are spectacular, and the plot is riveting. Kylo Ren is an outstanding character with amazing acting, Hux is outstandingly acted, and the John Williams score is out of this world. Definitely a must watch."
"Its a nice enough movie, even if it recycles old themes."
"It was not the worst movie ever, but the plot sucks."
"It is an okay start to a Sequel Star Wars trilogy. There's a lot of A New Hope in it but also new elements in it like a storm trooper defecting bringing us a new perspective that storm troopers are people. The Death Star thing of A New Hope is reused but now it's a planet. There's a lot with Finn with a lightsaber so he could end up being force sensitive. Rey is almost immediately very good with the force so she's probably been using it her whole life. Luke has disappeared but has left a map behind to find him. The galaxy doesn't even remember the Jedi or the things that happened in the original trilogy!
It could be better but it could also be a lot worse. I'd recommend watching 1-6 before watching the Sequels. Just so it's in order and so you know what's going on. 4, 5, & 6 are the original trilogy that's why they look older."
"Best Star Wars movie yet. Just phenomenal. If you haven't seen this yet I highly recommend it."
"The best start for the trilogy, mysterious background for the building main character, it will make you think."
"Hey, do you want to watch A New Hope but worse? If so, this movie is for you!"
"Sad attempt to ""reboot"" episode 4, without calling it that or explaining the parallels. They don't make sense either, nor does the rest of the story. The characters range from boring to annoying and are definitively all shallow. This movie made me stop watching star wars."
"This i just a worse copy of a new hope to be honest same plot same plotpoints if you are doing a rewatch of the saga and for some reason want to watch to watch the disney ones watch a new hope twice"
"Introduces us to the characters very well, while presenting us with a justifiable plot."
"Such a fun movie that introduced some really fun characters and had some really awesome emotional beats! Star Wars is fun again and also has an awesome story with good characters."
"Blatantly obvious callbacks and references to the original trilogy make this movie age like bread,  but it provides many intriguing new characters and story threads, though many of them are shunned. Yes, it's fun, and yes, it'll please the general audience, but no, The Force Awakens does not take the saga anywhere new nor use its tremendous potential to its advantage."
"A promising start to a new generation of Star Wars."
"They did such a good job with this movie, only to spend the next two movies destroying the entire franchise"
"Se tiraron la franquicia , no crearon personajes sólidos improvisaron todo el tiempo"
"In my opinion it's just a decent movie. Not enough poe Dameron for me, but Finn and Rey are good enough as the main characters to make the movie enjoyable. I was surprised upon rewatch to find that Kylo Ren is a very good villain (I don't find him to be very good in the other two). There's enough good in the movie to keep me from being bored, but at the same time I always find myself waiting for the movie to end rather than enjoying what I'm watching. A good movie and definitely a good setup to the new trilogy."
"What did I think of Star Wars: The Force Awakens? Check out my review below:
https://open.spotify.com/episode/41avAds6a7F2sbfUnwxTva?si=jjoIOaoWTJOe30aa01bbdQ"
"This movie made so happy because I love star wars"
"We had no clue it would be like this for the rest of the films.
What a truly horrible experience. I can't stand what they've done."
"very sad excuse for star wars movie"
"This is the second best Kylo Ren movie. It's fun with magic sword fights, but it's also missing a lot of basic plot development. Like, it's clear who the bad guys are, but they also don't really do anything in the whole movie until they blow up a planet out of nowhere. What are they up to? What's so bad about them that they're blowing up planets? It's never explained. Rey is cool and a good sword fighter and has a good hair style. Overall a good movie but I would have liked more explanations for the stuff that was going on. Also I thought the whole time that Kylo Ren was secretly Rey's dad, which made some of the movie pretty weird. Then later you find out her parents were just nobodies. So what was the point of all the intrigue? 5 stars for Kylo Ren, minus a star for refusing to explain anything that's going on in the entire movie."
"This was a great comeback for the Star Wars series. This movie has some really interesting characters. Great film."
"A ""Mary Sue"", a bad copy of Han Solo, an ethnic quota, and tons of nostalgia, go fight against a spoiled kid, attempting to recreate on screen Episode IV. It had so much potential! If they would have only set their aims on telling a good story instead of being progressive/inclusive/snowflake/empowering, and failing miserably!..."
"This movie overall is great! But, It feels like a copy to the orignal movies. Let me explain. In episode 7, Rey is a no one, has no parents, etc. She fins a droid, finds Han Solo, Finds the rebelian, A relitive to the rebelian is in the dark side(Kylo Ren). And in A new hope, Luke is a nobody, No family, Finds droids, Finds han solo, Finds rebelian, his father(a relitive) is with the dark side. I dont think it was nessassary to do another 3 star wars movies. They kinda ruined the saga. Because its weird that after 3 movies focused on the 'chosen one' and 3 movies focused on the villan, they made another 3 claiming that luke was not teh chosen one. So, its either that episode 7, 8 and 9 ruined the saga. Or the episode 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 were for nothing."
"Hmm, If you have seen star wars a new hope, you have already seen this film. Except this film is not as witty, or exciting. Some good action scenes, but the overall feeling you get watching this movie is that it is just a cynical rehash of the original star wars movie. Sad, as I believe there is a lot of material out there they could have used as opposed to raking over previously used material."
"A new hope with the old and new cast."
"This movie is in a very strange place upon the Skywalker saga. When you think about it, this movie did not really need to be made at all in the first place. But this movie is just so good that it makes itself feel like it belongs in this saga. Although this movie is pretty much a copy and paste of A New Hope, it creates its own set of new characters that are likable and have depth (unlike the prequels). And Darth Vader has some serious competition now that we have Kylo Ren. Honestly, before I even watched this movie, I was just hoping that it would be better than the prequels. And thank God it was. I enjoyed the crap out of watching this movie. The editing was also fantastic. The only things that bothered me with this movie were some semi-cringey lines and other lines that should have been re-shot. But this is still a very solid and carefully crafted film that puts itself high up on the ranks as one of the best Star Wars movies."
"It's good, I'd recommend it"
"New Hope remake done better than the original."
"Not a bad stand-alone movie but ruined by the rest of the trilogy.  Didn't add anything to Star Wars.  Should not have been made."
"Very enjoyable but packed with nostalgia which can sometimes be too jarring (e.g. Starkiller Base). Also Rey is far too good at everything to be relatable. Still a great movie. Also Last Jedi removes all intrigue set up in this movie."
"Awesome to see it on the big screen again!!"
"El villano no tiene una motivación real."
"I cant understand why people like this movie so much. It is devoid of any originality (basically a cynical remake of Star Wars a New Hope). Harrison Ford & Carrie Fisher  performances look wooden and unconvincing. Even the big baddie Kylo Ren comes across as a petulant teenager rather than a Darth Vader like super villain Sith lord. Whats amazing to me is that the follow on fils are even worse. Apparently I am missing something amazing about these films for them to have a 86% Fresh Rating."
"What a waste. Zero creativity, sincerity. It is stupid. A greedy project produced by frauds and directed by a super fraud."
"I don't care I just don't care"
"An entertaining start to the Sequel Trilogy, although it follows a familiar framework established by the first star wars movie."
"It's a well-made Star Wars movie with good characters and practical effects. To many Star Wars fans, this movie was a breath of fresh air after the prequels. Even I really liked it when it came out. But later I realized that this movie played it way too safe and it's basically just a copy of A New Hope. In my view, it was such a missed opportunity to take the story in new directions with the New Republic in power. The struggle throughout the original trilogy was to defeat the Empire and restore the Republic. But here in this movie, it's just rebels vs. Empire all over again, which makes it like the victory at the end of Return of the Jedi is completely irrelevant. People blame The Last Jedi for ruining the sequel trilogy, but I blame this movie. With this movie, JJ Abrams set up the trilogy to erase the 6-film arc and just be a retread of the original trilogy. He's a good director but a terrible storyteller. Disney should have just adapted the Thrawn book trilogy with JJ Abrams or Rian Johnson  as director.  Also, Rey is a Mary Sue, but that's not the biggest issue with the movie (at least Daisy Ridley gives a good performance)."
"A New Hope Part 2. Nothing new"
"It was good but it was sad that Han Solo died."
"Rey is such a Mary Sue."
"It's not hard to copy paste and change a few details and still wind up with a pretty good thing.    Ask me about my 4th grade research paper on great white sharks.        Buuuuuut this is a multimillion dollar deal with a famed franchise.     Lucas in episode 1 took a chance for his next trilogy to tell the story of how we got Vader.       Tough order too.     
So what was this trilogy's announcement?  What are we setting up?    Tune in next movie to not find out.     But it was entertaining so you gotta give it the points as such.        Honestly it coulda been so much worse..... aaaaand better.    Next time can Rey lose once or twice so I can connect to the ""Luke"" of this story?   Cause I don't win every single day at every given moment.       3.5/5 is still good enough to take your kids or buy on blue Rey.... see.... little joke there?"
"Never as good as the first time you watch it. It's pretty good apart from a familiar plot and way too many conveniences."
"No, it was not good.

No, the plot does not make sense.

No, the dialogue wasn't that much better than the original trilogy's dialogue.

This wasn't a first possible step to greatness: it was the Star Wars franchise' foot catching on the edge of a really long, jagged, nail-ridden stairwell that it has summarily tumbled down and become disfigured because of."
"While the action and visual effects are spot on, the plot is inadequate while the acting is like watching a dead tree."
"Not as good as the original Star Wars trilogy, but has many good moments."
"So nice to be back at the movies...along with masks and social distancing."
"A pesar de ser muy parecida a ""Una Nueva Esperanza"". Tiene varios elementos muy nuevos y frescos."
"I understand it's been several years since the last Star Wars movie came out, but this movie was really just a retelling of the first Star Wars movie with different characters. If that was the point, then they should have left Leia, Luke, Han, and Chewie out of it. Ignoring that, the movie was beautiful with tons of action, but way too little character development for a Star Wars movie."
"Star Wars is back bitches!!"
"A brilliant start to a new saga that should be remembered and not tossed to the rancor!"
"still a very good movie. it's holding up well over time."
"Great movie, only problem is it’s a replica copy of episode 4"
"The best of the sequels!"
"While technically brilliant in its effects and set pieces, Force Awakens simultaneously copies and destroys what we loved in the previous movies. As usual, I enjoyed the non-speaking characters the most (BB8, Chewy)."
"One of the best Star Wars films since the 80s and I love it so much. The effects are really good, the actors are charming, the writing is sharp, the story is a bit on the nose but it makes up for it with some good ideas."
"I know it's random.
I realise it's unnecessary.
But it's only the third time I've seen it and I think it BLUDY WELL DESERVES A REVIEW!
May I first point out that every frame in this film would work as a desktop background? And that there isn't much else to say except – it is a GOOD film.
You will occasionally hear people whinge on about how this film sucks, and so I think it's my duty and right, as an all-inclusive Star Wars fanatic (except Rebels …… go away Rebels) to tell them to shoosh.
Actually. You know what? Let them whinge. Let them get sh***ed off over Disney's redoing of the original trilogy. See if I care.
I mean, hey, let's get this straight — there's nothing WORTH complaining about other than the fact that it's a slight copy cat of the OT. And that's exactly what I'm here to talk about.
There is NOOOO denying that a couple of scenes from TFA replicate that of aforementioned trilogy. In fact, I've made a LIST of them (elsewhere).
But can I say that stepping out from under the shadow of George Lucas' baby (or should I say, giant), to produce something to please ""everyone"" using $300 billion, WITHOUT hesitating is no easy feat.
And by hesitating I mean incorporating a truckload of nostalgic elements, giving the nod to scenes, themes and lines we all know and love and just generally doing fan service (something TRoS took too much advantage of).
Do I think it's uncreative for J.J. to resort to the old stuff? Well it's a creative DECISION, so technically NO … but yes.
And if seeing a lightsaber being extracted from the snow doesn't piss you off too much, I say you either: shurrup and embrace it OR go into exile on Anch-To.

😤

Verdict: Good. Unforgettable. May contain references to the original movies."
"Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.

I understand that classic Star War fans will hate the new trilogy (and after the Prequels, its understandable that they would be scared), but I was never a big ""Space Wizards"" fan, so adding some action to some fresh characters in the same great universe was the way to go for me.

Daisy Ridley and John Boyega do an amazing job, and Adam Driver does a decent job of making me hate Kylo Ren.

Giving a new feel on an old formula is honestly an art form, and I think they nailed it.

While I wish they had covered more about the Sith during a point of obvious advantage, I'm sure the expanded universe stories will eventually cover the Sith."
"Force Awakens has absolutely unique or creative to offer. It plays it safe in literally the worst way, by copy-pasting the New Hope with just some new characters. Rey, Kylo, and Finn were entertaining and fleshed out and that's about the only redeeming part of this bland, basic movie. Action was fun to look at tho."
"Generally not that bad, other then Rey whom I can't understand what is she doing."
"The Force Awakens was the very first Star Wars movie uI saw in theaters (I was too young to see the prequels). I saw this movie in theaters three days after Christmas... and that was a day I will never ever forget."
"By far the best film of the sequel trilogy.  Though far from the best in the franchise TFA laid some very decent ground work for the the next two films to completely abandon/ destroy.  Unfortunately, lightsabers no longer dismember or kill people, since its Disney, they only get wittle scratches, seems petty but it completely changes the franchise. There were some other blaring inconsistencies but TFA led me to believe Star Wars was at least in average hands."
"The Force is Strong! Kylo is awesome! I hope the next movie doesn't have him without his mask and topless coz that would really suck and undo all the good work of this movie."
"The Force Awakens feels very different now compared to when it was new. We've seen the whole sequel trilogy and it was just not good enough. The Force Awakens is the best of the sequels but the movie is too much of a copy of the original Star Wars. It completed the task of making people excited about Star Wars again, by making us ask questions. Just wish the answers were more satisfying. I still enjoy The Force Awakens but not nearly as much that I used to."
"Bad start for another threelogy, maybe they'll get better in the next installment. Update: Naah, it got only worse at the end."
"La película se me hizo lenta, la acción escasa y nada disfrutable, además de que es remake del episodio 4."
"I had so much fun with The Force Awakens. It's amazing to see those familiar faces; Han, Chewie, Leia and so on and the new characters introduced (Rey, Finn, Poe, BB8) are off to a great start. The action and visuals are outstanding. Kylo Ren, although not as intimidating as Darth Vader, is pretty damn scary. Most of all, this is an insane improvement, obviously, over the prequels. Can't wait for more."
"I was really excited for this movie when it came out. Unfortunately, as I watched it in the theater, I remember growing more and more disappointed as I saw the tone that was being set for the sequel trilogy: ""Let's play it safe and repackage the old movies, rather than making something original and taking just a single risk."" The only thing that had me excited walking out of that theater was the hope that we will all surely see something new and interesting in the next installment of the series."
"The movie was a clear rip off of A New Hope."
"Watching whole last 3 movies was so cringe that i literally feel bad, its the most senseless boring shit ever, full of sentimental pictures and etc"
"This was the movie that saved Star Wars when it came out. J.J. Abrams did good with this one.

Final Rating: A-"
"Not really a new episode, its just part 4 but worst and full of fan service"
"Amazing movie, great comeback for the Star Wars series. This movie has some really interesting characters."
"was a little bit boring"
"Star Wars the force awakens is my favorite Disney made Star Wars movie. Did the movie have problems? Of course it did but I cam follow the story better. With the other two I don't really know what they're doing especially in the Last Jedi. But this one the plot was pretty clear. Find the map to Luke. The action was fun. Seeing Han and Leia was great. I was excited for the new characters and how they would be developed. I just had a lot of fun with this movie and I wish the rest of the trilogy could've been like this."
"I don't appreciate this being so similar to ""The last home"" only with even more absurdity and squandering of the potential to start an interesting new story."
"I know people praise this movie, but i honestly don't know why. It is good for sure, but it was ultimately a rehash of ""Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope"". They have so much in common. The tone is different, but there are way too many similarities, up to the point were i think it's ridiculous. It was nice to see characters we love and enjoy again in a Star Wars movie. Even though it was to throw nostalgia all over the place, without any reason. Luke is only in it for standing around. And that annoys me. He should have had a scene with Han before he dies. That would have been amazing. But NO. The lightsaber sequences are weaker than in any other of the movies, and they are not entertaining in the slightest. This movie is only as good, because we get to see some characters we love in a movie that is a new edition of ""A New Hope"". Still doesn't mean it is bad."
"It was a movie that happened"
"This film revived the Star Wars franchise, it was a very difficult task, but Disney managed to make a cool and fun movie with very good characters, it's a brave film, it kills Han Solo who is an iconic character, he brings up a very good villain Kylo Ren, too bad this film is almost a remake of the first film in the franchise."
"I think this Star Wars is good I feel like it is a copy of A New Hope which is why I give it 4mstars but it has amazing visuals a good but reused story and overall just good characters"
"This movie feels more and more empty each time I rewatch it. Just a rehash of A New Hope, but with worse characters and an insane number of contrived plot conveniences that the movie doesn't even attempt to explain."
"The Phantom Menace was better than this cinematic disaster. This movie is completely unoriginal and adds nothing new to the Star Wars universe. J.J Abrams literally copied A New Hope and added better special effects and racially diverse casts"
"it could be good if the follow up movies were but they werent and so that movie is bad
too 
as a stand alone it just doesent work"
"The best of the new bunch. Familiar story but with new life breathed into it. An excellent return to the franchise."
"This is the start of the death row for Star Wars.
Enter REY! The most impossible poorly written uncool character in the history of Star Wars.
No training, who cares? She is an overnight Yoda-level Force Practitioner. 
Why train for decades like Anakin and Luke when you can just hold a lightsaber and just beat the baddest Sith Lord in town who trained with the Last Grand Master Jedi?
Talk about political agendas, identity politics and pleasing the diversity triggered police. I mean this was beyond obvious! 
But we aint done... lets take the coolest guy in the galaxy and make him a looser drifting pirate that keep using the same clothing for 40 years and leaves a beautiful princess behind for no good reason. Lets take away from him his happy ending that he fought for so bravely... not that in all the books he doesnt become a general and respected leader, lets just toss away all those books and comics written after the movie and just make him the worst.

LETS KILL HAN SOLO! That should set the first of many great deaths of what made the Star Wars Saga the coolest ever!"
"They tried to make it great again before it got destroyed. This movie had so many of us in tears, smiling, waiting for the past to meet the future. Could've been better but it was the best in the franchise we got since Disney took over. JJ did an admirable job."
"It's good enough to hang with the prequels great action."
"A nostalgic trip to the time of the original trilogy."
"Watching this was like watching someone wipe their ass with your childhood toys while patronizing you in a very boring tone for a couple of hours. I was lured back into watching by movie 6 after giving up on SW after prequel 1. This really is the turd in the punchbowl and shatters the whole milieu for me so that even the more meritorious movies in this rotting franchise are impossible to enjoy. Whoever made this can go to hell."
"I’m sorry what was this? Rey got way to overpower way to quickly and don’t try to say she “trained with Luke” I wouldn’t call swinging a stick around training and she was just swinging it at a rock not training droid no good teachings from Luke so no I did not like this movie"
"its just a copy of episode 4, but somewhat trash, it tries to introduce new characters but they are completely boring, and its just an insult that a base the magnitude of starkiller base was blown up that easy."
"Probably my favorite of the series. The last one was a disaster."
"I really think Disney should give George lukas his films back because what Disney did with them was garbage 

Rough one and solo were good movies but holly crap the sequels are disgusting"
"It's basically a remake of A New Hope, but not as good."
"The movie was mediocre at best, the main character has no personality and is a Mary Sue in very sense of the title. The flashing lights and pretty colours are top quality though."
"A great new start for the Star Wars saga! It captured George Lucas's Star Wars spirit and respected what came before. JJ Abrams is brilliant and did a fantastic job and The Force Awakens is a treat for all Star Wars and new fans. John Williams did a fantastic job with the music as always. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver were fantastic! Rey's hero journey is just as profound as Lukes was!"
"Wow I went to see this in cinema and it blew me away but the two films following this were alot better in my opinion just played it a bit to safe to begin the sequel trilogy but a good film. All round"
"who are all these characters .... is this Harry Potter"
"For how long it was between the Revenge of the Sith and the release of this movie, it was a decent addition to the saga. However, it wasn't unique at all is more of a modern remake of A New Hope than an actual addition to the Star Wars universe."
"Considering that Ray is a Mary Sue, this film sucks... Along with its mediocre excuse of a Star War sequel franchise."
"The force awakens?. More like force destroyed. Trash movie and a tarnish on the entire franchise"
"This is just the beginning of a horrible trilogy. It only gets worse from here."
"Doesn't deserve the praise that the critics gave it. Wasn't original at all. Practically A New Hope but with better special effects."
"It's the remake of episode IV, with excellent action sequences."
"A lot of people criticize this movie for being too similar to a new hope and that Rey is a mary sue but I disagree. I wouldn't rewatch this movie but I didn't hate it and I know for a fact people liked this movie"
"Great Star Wars film! The end fight scene in the snow is one of my favourites out of all the movies!"
"would of rated it higher if it wasn't like the damn originals and having rey being an utter god"
"The Force Awakens introduces us to many new characters, all with promising stories that can flourish into something great. It combines the themes of the past with the creativity of something new to create a beautiful dynamic throughout the movie keeping the audience guessing for what happens next."
"Copied Episode 4. Bad characters. Mary sue main character. Looks cool but actually not."
"This is an adventure movie that played it safe, but had a ton of delightful elements along the way. Not the most original movie, but it did what it had to in order to restore folks faith in Star Wars at the box office."
"This movie is a okay remake of a film from the 70's, why is Fin so sweaty all the time.  Also kyloRen gets beat by some one who has never held a lightsaber, he is is just edgy teen vader."
"Crap, wasted 2  hours of my life. Horrible, every single person involved in the production of this movie should move to a third world country and farm pigs for the rest of their lives."
"Unbelievable movie. Daisy Ridley brings abeautiful introduction to her Character Rey. Adam Driver is incredible with his inner conflict and feelings, whilst looking badass. Han Solo, and Leia amazing! One of the best  Star Wars films with The Rise Of Skywalker!"
"The Force is indeed awake...J.J. hit it out of the park."
"Many Feels, Much Nostalgia"
"Movie stared off good. I only seen this movie about four times and it became worst after each view. Harrison Ford is the only great thing in this one. Don't expect much from it."
"Buena y sin mas que decir. Es una película cumplidora, pero JJ Abrams no se atreve a arriesgar, trae a nosotros lo que queremos ver, nada nuevo, mucho menos algo innovador, es lo malo de esta película, no se tuvo el atrevimiento de contar una nueva historia por completo."
"The Force Awakens breathes life back into the Star Wars universe. From the story to the acting to the visuals. Everything is amazing. It also gives a new generation their version of Star Wars. I am glad they decided to follow a girl that was not from anywhere important as the main character because it shows young girls that they can be just as good as Luke or Anakin. Very good movie!"
"Looked good, but everything else was recycled from the originals ..."
"Does plot even matter in these movies?"
"Great return to the franchise"
"Great world building and a reintroduction to the universe with a new group of characters."
"its just a new hope again but with a mary sue and incoherences"
"A good movie to start of a trilogy with new characters to enjoy and old characters to remember. This movie was good and is very enjoyable"
"Unoriginal and rehashed the same story from episode 4. I completely head-canon this episode out of the Star Wars saga."
"Brilliant film! So happy to see this brought to life again."
"Great beginning to a trilogy. Looked so promising"
"Episode 7 .... Only Disney and his modifications with skinny arguments, with a couple of protagonists who have discussions with linens, seem to be taken from a series of children from Nickelodeon, a villain who starts well but then collapses losing strength and being defeated by two beginners with lightsaber, a hologram of a character that has no comparison with that of Sidiousm who does not awaken ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING of mystery. For me a lazy script, an overly simplistic argument, The film can be told like this: It is to find a plane to find Luke FIN. Wow! Lucas please make the movies again, it only remains for Goofi to appear in the next installment!"
"SORRY BUT THIS FRANCHISE WAS OFFICIALLY DONE WITH AFTER REVENGE OF THE SITH!!!"
"An amazing entry to the Skywalker Saga. A lot of heart, tension, laughs and cries"
"A new hope 2.0. No new ideas wasted characters and insults your intelligence at times. An ok way to spend 2 hours."
"A great start to the new trilogy."
"could have been a good start for the trilogy"
"Though it has a cohesive plot and interesting characters, it absolutely lacks innovation. This brings nothing new to the franchise. It is still fun and visually stunning."
"This movie is quite good, to me it is the best of the new Star Wars movies. My main problem with the movie is Kylo Ren. He has hissy fits when something doesn't go the way he wanted."
"One of the safest and uninspired movies I've ever watched. Disney really screwed up big time."
"The perfect return to a legendary franchise with modern filmmaking, acting, and story building that fits right at nostalgic home."
"I absolutely hated this movie. Carrie Fisher’s life choices of extreme drugs and alcohol just permeated her roll and you could almost imagine Harrison Ford in an early meeting telling Lucas “ok, I’ll do one more but you gotta kill me off in this one”. Ugh. Not the Star Wars I grew up. I’d take Jar Jar over this any day."
"This is totally the best Star Wars movie ever. I loved the comedy and the return of characters, giving nostalgia to all Star Wars diehards. Great storyline introduced and I found a lot interesting about this movie. Rey, Finn, and Poe are all made the best by this movie."
"Man - Star Wars is cool! Episode VII takes place thirty years after the Destruction of the second Death Star, and the fall of Palpatine and the Empire. We're introduced to new and charming characters, as well as truly intimidating ones. Never before has Star Wars looked better, or been so entertaining, as the tension feels heightened. Both sides feel like they have a lot to lose - the First Order feels like it's just starting to gain its power, while the Resistance is barely managing to hold together. The story beats hit hard, specifically with Kylo Ren. Driver and Ridley shine in their roles, with the latter bringing acrobatics and fierce independence that we haven't seen in the franchise before. The action flows smoother, the lightsabers hum louder and it's still satisfying to see Storm Troopers get theirs. Yup! Star Wars will always be cool to me."
"Extremely bad. This was the last Star Wars movie I went to the cinema for!"
"It's good. ‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎"
"In all honesty its just a worse version of A New Hope."
"Least bad of the final Skywalker trilogy."
"Not super original with the plot and I’m still not sure I like the casting or if the writing is just cheesy in the intense scenes. Really great as an experience and should be seen at least once."
"Not too bad. It's at least better than old episodes, which are too  outdated in a modern view. But, it is too similar to episode IV, so yes, there isn't much originality beside some extreme political correctness."
"Great to be back at the Star Wars Universe!"
"A New Hope clone, albeit a pretty entertaining one"
"Good movie trilogy starter"
"Destroys the saga. Thanks Disney,  Kathleen Kennedy et. al."
"This was one of the best ways to re-enter the franchise with Rey, Finn, and Poe and old characters this movie has everything"
"mary sue who does not add to movie much. Did not appreciate new characters."
"The future was bright and open wide again. They introduced good characters, and reminded you of Star Wars. It was not the most creative film ever made, and missed some opportunities."
"Could have been better for all they tried to put into it. Ultimately Bad."
"The reason why I get it 1 and a half is because there was a little that I like. However, it is just a reskinned of a new hope. Also, there is nothing new in this Star Wars. This whole trilogy is a mess. This movie was good but connecting it to the other sequels of this story and what came before doesn't make sense. The whole sequelogy is a fanfic not canon mess. Before starting to make a trilogy that's a sequel to Star Wars should of made a plan that is more story driven then having the two directors have a custody battle and assigning a power that is genderless a gender. It's not what gender or race the main characters are that make Star Wars great, it's the story and the character development that made it great. The whole sequel trilogy is Star Wars in name only and that's all that it is. There is nothing that actual feels like Star Wars in these three movies. Should of plan the sequel trilogy better to make it Star Wars through out."
"Let's kill off everyone The audience cares about and replace them with characters we don't. Because DISNEY."
"Repleto de nostalgia, um filme perfeito"
"Great pacing, characters and new ideas sprinkled throughout the film. An engaging watch. Though it borrows some ideas from ot and clone wars but still stands on its on."
"JJ Abrams did it to everyone AGAIN.

Look at the mystery box everyone!  Don't you want to know what's inside?  Aren't you just salivating at the thought of all that already written solutions to all these questions?

A good question, for another time."
"Great visuals. Good start of new trilogy. Unfortunately failed on promises."
"The originals are better"
"When I first saw this movie, I loved it. But I feel as if the rest of the sequel trilogy has made TFA worse. The plot threads either were cast aside or answered in an unsatisfactory manner. I remember seeing this movie in theaters, and I loved all the new characters like Finn and Rey and Kylo Ren. I was so exited to watch them develop. But unfortunately, they barely did over the next two movies and that makes this feel worse. I really liked Rey and Finn’s friendship in this movie and it was tossed aside in TLJ and not as prominent in TROS. My biggest problem with this movie was the lack of originality. Everybody says it’s a copy of ANH — they are all correct. I won’t list all the similarities, but the original Star Wars did it better. When I watched this movie and there was another Death Star (Starkiller Base) I thought to myself “Come on! Another? After the first two Death Stars blew up?” However, I could overlook this and enjoy the movie for what it was. When Finn and Rey fought Kylo Ren in the snow, the first time I saw it I was excited. I thought it was so cool how when Finn was defeated Rey came in and fought Kylo. I thought it was so cool. Now, though, I am irritated. Kylo sliced Finn with his lightsaber in the back and Finn only got a scratch. Rey got Kylo in the face and he only got a scratch. That’s not how lightsabers work! They’re deadly weapons that cut people in half, and the fact that Rey/Finn didn’t hurt themselves with a lightsaber when they had no training is ridiculous. Finn probably should’ve at least been paralyzed from Kylo slicing him but he wasn’t. I have other questions. How was the First Order able to afford to build everything? How did Maz get the lightsaber? Why did the lightsaber give Rey visions? Why did Leia hug Rey instead of Chewie, who she actually knows? Why did Rey beat Kylo with no training? Just because she’s a Palpatine doesn’t give her a pass; just because you’re related to someone who was good with lightsabers doesn’t mean you’ll be. There is also a lot of coincidences in this movie like a force sensitive girl finding the droid with important information and running into a former stormtrooper who happens to have Poe’s jacket, and they happen to escape on the Millennium Falcon, and that happens to be found by none other than Han Solo. I think the problem with sequels, just in general, is that they ruin the happy endings that the series originally had. Anakin killed Palpatine and fulfilled his destiny, and Luke redeemed his father. The rebels won... but now it feels like everything they did was POINTLESS. Whenever I look at something that is Star Wars, I think about how all their hard work was pointless. Almost all of the OT characters die, like Han Solo did in this movie. So why did they make this?... oh, money. I don’t think this movie was bad. It was quite enjoyable. But I couldn’t give it five stars because of the reasons I stated above. The thing is, we want to wonder about what happened to our favorite characters after ROTJ, not see them all die... like Han Solo died in this one :("
"I don't see where the hate was coming from with this movie. It was thrilling, funny, and entertaining.  I could almost ignore the fact that Ray was perfect in every way, and therefore left little room for growth."
"A good jump back into the Star Wars universe after ten years. 'The Force Awakens' brings in new characters with more interesting backstories than the prequel trilogy and doesn't forget about the nostalgia. If you were expecting the writers to develop a new radical plot for our new band of heroes to conquer, then you'll be sorely disappointed. Overall, great cinematography, score, and acting, but lacks in creativity and plausibility."
"This was a disappointment. The is a remake and the same recipe as Episode IV. This time a lone girl on a desert planet with, what a coincidence Force Powers who meets up with a droid who has a secret, that leads to some some ship adventures and fighting Stormtroopers who's appearance has not changed in 30 years or the Tie fighters. Instead of the Empire you have The First Order. Instead of the Rebellion it's the Resistance. A skinny mini-me Darth Vader who looks like a hipster and guess what a bigger Death Star to destroy!!! Sound Familiar?? 1977 Star Wars! Basically Star Wars 2015.0!!"
"Having seen the rest of the mess of a trilogy, I decided to revisit this film, which I enjoyed, although found flawed when it first came out. I conclude that this movie has not aged well even in less than 5 years, and bares the roots of what hurt the overall trilogy. Much has been made of the unoriginality, but it goes deeper than that. First off, this movie is very short. At just 2 hours and 15 minutes long it is the shortest of the last five SW films, and is much closer in length to a film like Spider Man Homecoming than most SW films, let alone films like Infinity War or Endgame. It is unusual to do this when you are planning to in just 3 films try to reintroduce OT character, introduce new characters, create a new overarching threat for the trilogy and supposedly provide closure for the whole episodic SW saga, a feat more analogous to event movies like IW/Endgame than like a random MCU installment. But I think this could've been overcome with the right direction. But instead, JJ seemed to lean into this, with a frenetic pace that didn't allow supposed emotional moments like Finn's admission to Rey to hit and led to weird moments like Leia comforting Rey when Han died though she barely knew Rey and Rey hardly knew Han. A few more scenes of bonding between these characters would've helped this, but instead, events seemed to just go along because they wanted Finn and Rey to be certain characters in future movies (Other examples are Rey volunteering to go on a mission to find Luke in a distant place when she was supposedly committed to waiting for her parents on Jakuu, something TLJ tried to rectify but ROS screwed back up, as well as Finn giving one liners when he has just escaped from his tragic and complex background). Compare this to the moments of slowness and character development such as the bond between Luke and Obi Wan in ANH. Another issue is the forced fan service, with moments like Han finding the Falcon feeling a lot less awesome and more like plot convenience (again to fit the speedy pace) outside of the environment of a packed theater in late 2015. Finally, the biggest issue I'd say is the central conflict of the movie. I said I'd stay away from criticizing the movie's originality and I tried to be ok with the similarities through much of the movie. But on both viewings, one copy bothered me and that was the Starkiller Base. Not only was this unoriginal but it didn't fit within the narrative of the film itself. The Death Star works in ANH because it is introduced from the start, in the opening crawl. TFA however presents itself at the beginning to be about this Resistance, backed by the Republic, being in a race with the First Order to find out about Luke's whereabouts. Then, what is presented as a bigger, badder Death Star is presented without warning, over halfway into (again an already short) movie, killing one of those organizations, the Republic without it having been relevant to the plot at all. The plot that was presented about Luke is resolved randomly at the very end, with no explanation given (R2D2 is just suddenly awake with what they need to find him). Changing the main conflict of the film halfway through is just bad writing, and seems to be done just because of laziness/fan service. It doesn't even work as a surprise, because it's a reused idea in a film where we have already seen reused ideas play out in the same way. This is all too bad, because it detracts from what is a well acted and visually stunning film. In conclusion, I would say TFA fails not just because it is a remake of ANH, but also because it is a poor one."
"I gave half a star because it's not The Rise of Skywalker and 2 stars because it's not The Last Jedi. So many possibilities to make an amazing movie with an amazing story but instead was the beginning of a very long, incredibly bad, cringeworthy joke. Thanks for nothing Disney."
"Its great start to the newest trilogy"
"This movie is not as good as the prequels and the originals IMO, but it's pretty good. I do like the new characters. The main issue with this movie is that it has too many similar aspects to A New Hope. Other than that, it's a good movie."
"Trash. Garbage. Redo these movies please!"
"It's a complete rehash of the original Star Wars but their only going through the motions completely missing the spirit of the original and what made it so great"
"Brutal regreso de Star Wars."
"The plot of this movie is a joke.
It destroys what was built by the classic and prequel movies.
Everything is out of proportion."
"Packed with action and populated by both familiar faces and fresh blood, The Force Awakens successfully recalls the series' former glory while injecting it with renewed energy."
"The Force Awakens is an affectionate love letter to the original Star Wars trilogy, with impressive technical effects and action scenes, and an engaging story that shows promise for future installments that would eventualy turn in dissapointment."
"Serves as a fun homage to the OG trilogy and a commentary on Star Wars myths, while introducing new interesting characters"
"There's heart, but that can't save it from unengaging pacing, a rehashed plot, and rather unlikable characters. It's not bad, but it's definitely not good. 75%."
"The first half hour is a really good movie! It's only when the plot gets moving that it has problems. Daisy Ridley brings a lot to her rôle, even though it's poorly written. 

Although it is a passable cinematic  experience it's weighed down by plot holes, puzzling lapses in logic and uninspired direction."
"It was completely different from the Prequel and Original, which makes sense since this is the Sequel. It is pretty cool and awesome, especially the ending."
"Great comeback, solid action"
"Un ottimo inizio per la nuova parte della saga di Star Wars. Appassionante, avvincente, che colpisce molto lo spettatore."
"It was nostalgic and I love the new characters but this movie was so safe it didn't do much for me. Cool Star Wars movie nevertheless."
"I feel this is a good start is not the best but entertained."
"While the purpose of the movie was to pay homage to the original trilogy, the film could've done a few things with new and unique ideas instead of copying and pasting ""A New Hope."" However, The Force Awakens did bring back great memories and was fun to watch. Great acting from John Boyega,  Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, and of course, the Legacy cast: Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and (even if he didn't say anything from the movie) Mark Hamill."
"boring, immersion breaking and it does not even hide that it is a rehash of every minute of the old trilogy, while it entirely ingnores the fresh content of the prequels."
"The movie was fantastic is the most interesting movie of the Star Wars saga. It has the story of Kylo Ran and Luke. This movie is inforgetable.
                                     It was a good movie."
"The movie is very interesting there is a lot of action, it isn't boring, the characters are good, the plot isn't repetitive and the soundtrack is very nice. With the force Kylo Ren almost kill Ray."
"It doesn't need to exist. It's just Disney's way of cashing in on the Star Wars brand. It's not a bad movie, it's just not really Star Wars. The Star Wars story ended at Return of the Jedi. That was the perfect ending. No need to go on with what is is essentially the same premise as A New Hope. But if you can get past that, it's not a bad watch."
"Instead of the confusion and ever-changing story of the other films outside the OT, Force Awakens delivers a back-to-basics simple story that will keep viewers highly engaged with its visuals, characters and acting, even if it does seem to have many similarities to the film that started it all."
"Steady but a little boring. Not a brilliant work, just not bad."
"There's making an homage, then there's blatant rip-off; there is so much of A New Hope here that it blows my mind. (2.5/5)"
"even though it might feel like an imitation of episode iv, it' a great way to re-enter in the star wars universe."
"A great movie, first star wars movie that made me get into the franchise. So good."
"I haven't seen Solo yet, but this is easily so far the best thing Disney has ever done to Star Wars."
"Masterpeice! JJ introduces new characters and mixing them in with the old cast to deliver a great story thats true to the roots of star wars. Star wars is back!!"
"New Hope but worse. Kylo Ren is acting like an angsty teen and Rey is overpowered. Poe survived because...yeah. Finn is a comic relief even though he could have been the most interesting character in the movie. 
 The movie is still fun to watch and doesn't make you want to jump out of the window."
"Even though this is the most “Play It Safe” Film in the entire saga, it sure packs a huge punch that started the Sequel Trilogy off amazing!"
"A good start with good characters"
"THIS MOVIE RUINED STAR WARS FOR ME. IT COPIED EPISODE 4 IN MANY WAYS. SCREW YOU DISNEY."
"This movie does try too hard to be like A New Hope Andy the villain may not be as intimidating as previous villains. But that certainly doesn't mean that this film isn't fun and action packed, including some unexpected twists and turns."
"Fresh beginning for the franchise. Hated that Han Solo was killed though."
"This movie is the only movie from the new trilogy that has good pasting and good story. But as Stephen King said in IT Chapter 2: ""I Didn't like the Endin' """
"la fuerza despierta fue excelente para comenzar la era secuela de Star Wars"
"J.J. Abrams delivers a fun Star Wars thrill ride, even if it is a little by the numbers"
"A good movie with good characters. Although the plot was pretty similar to A New Hope, it had some differences that made it good."
"A good movie with flaws. My main complaints is that it is a rehash of A New Hope and Rey is a bit to op. Other than that this is a great movies with fun action scenes, nostalgia, great new characters and great scenes with the Original trilogy characters. Easily the best of the Sequel Trilogy"
"A love letter to a new hope, this movie is great"
"The farce awakens more like. What a total disappointment."
"The return of Star Wars was the best thing Disney did with it, it was really fun and did something that the prequels did not - it felt as good as the original trilogy."
"Didnt know what to expect when sitting down to watch this. But I mean it kinda seemed like we had a lot more coming in the trailer. It was good tho"
"The movie was watchable some negatives are the acting at points was some times unpolished or rough positives are it still gives off the same magic that drew me in as a kid and really felt like a part of the OG trilogy"
"Pros: The opening scene is Amazing especially when Kylo Ren catches a projectile with the force. Finn and Poe's bonding was great and they had great chemistry. Kylo Ren is a great villain and he has such a cool mask and lightsaber and he is the best character in the new trilogy for the most part. The map to find Luke SkyWalker idea was good and they made it so this movie wasn't too similar to a New Hope. The stuff with Rey on Jaku was pretty good and her flying the Millenium Falcon and Han Solo is the best he has ever been in StarWars in this movie and Harrison Ford gives off the performance of a lifetime. Chewbacca is great and seeing most of the original trilogy again was great. The stuff on Star Killer Base was great. Han Solo's death is the most heart-gripping death in StarWars' history. All the characters are very likable like Poe and Finn. It was nice seeing the original trilogy again and the comedy works and was my biggest surprise about this movie.

Cons: The movie feels a bit too similar to a New Hope. I feel like they wasted Captain Phasma in this movie. There is a couple of stupid scenes with Rey being a Mary-sue when she is captured.

I still really enjoy this movie and it is one of the most rewatchable StarWars movies.I'm going to give Starwars the Force Awakens an (A-)"
"forgetable and unfalorable to the prevous films buy the end the filmmakers had no idea how to take lucas's films the lacks immagation humor and story best not watch this film"
"The best entry into the new SW sequel trilogy. It introduces interesting new characters and sets up some intriguing plot points. The main critique of the film rings true for me as well - it leans way too heavily into nostalgia and lacks originality. It's basically a remake of A New Hope; but it doesn't kill the film. A solid entry to the SW universe."
"The best starwars movie since, Empire Strikes Back. Easily the third best star wars movie"
"The worst Star wars history! The whole film was annoying and the new characters was bad only Poe & BB-8 is good but the characters especially Rey,Kylo Ren and Finn are the worst characters in SW saga! This story is a copy-paste of epis.4 and the duels of sabers was really dumb a really shame for the ancients actors, they're returned was the only best thing of the film, but the film is not worth it, a bad trilogy SW!"
"Pleasant pastiche but devoid of any reason to care about literally anything that happens in the film."
"I think is a glorious return of the Star Wars Saga"
"Definitely got my excitement up for more content going forward.
Legends had some odd stories here and there, but the new cannon does too."
"This movie had high expectations and yet was completely derivative and failed to do anything unique. Another death star? The Empire is back, again, with some new lipstick? Come on now."
"This is a good introduction to the new trilogy. It has fun characters, some new locations and ideas, and plenty of strong action sequences. However, the film does not break enough new ground to be considered great. It feels quite similar to A New Hope, a film I love for its originality. Also, I think Adam Driver was a poor choice for a villain. He looks like an absolute loser as if Rodrick from Diary of a Wimpy Kid became evil. Overall, I enjoy the film even if it doesn't quite bring me back to the first 3 films."
"They tried to recreate Episode 4 in as few steps as possible. The accomplishments of all the characters from the Original Trilogy get completely wiped away so the not-Empire can fight the not-Rebel Alliance all over again, not matter how much damage it does to the world building of the galaxy. One of the laziest films I've ever seen, and the worst part is it is by far the strongest of the sequel trilogy."
"I'm a huge Star Wars fan, and I feel like this was a rather large disappointment.  JJ Abrams did what he was paid to do, so I don't begrudge him for that, but The Last Jedi is a better movie and no one can convince me otherwise.
Having just seen The Rise of Skywalker, this movie is a breath of fresh air compared to that.  15 times out of 10, I would watch this over The Rise of Skywalker."
"This movie is just so easy to enjoy.I don't really have much to say about the movie.The only things that I don't like is the dialogue.The movie's dialogue isn't bad it's just okay, and the fan service is pretty annoying.I will not address the Rey arguments just because they're dumb.Anyway the movie is good."
"Nice reboot for Star Wars (kind of a reboot). Nice break from the nightmare that was the prequels. Best one of this trilogy. Fun movie!"
"I had problems caring about the new characters, other than Finn that is.  Maybe the movie should have made him the lead instead of following the path they chose?  The whole thing was a search for Spock, I mean Luke, and the ending didn't pay off in any way.  I'm not sure this is the path forward for SW, maybe they should have let it be for another 10 years until someone actually had a story worth telling."
"Um filme muito bom um dos melhores de 2015 e o segundo melhor da saga Star Wars na minha opinião."
"The liberal propaganda machine ramming their ideology down our throats. It's a shame what happened to the last 3 movies"
"It's just a rehash, nothing much. 

B- 65%"
"trash reboot of episode IV"
"This new trilogy (episodes VII, VIII and IX) is completely dispensable and should be ignored, as it completely distorts everything that was previously done about Star Wars in films, books, games and comics"
"Shall we make a rehash of episode 4? Disney:"" why yes, yes of course. "" it was like watching episode 4 all over again. The only reason to watch was to see the old characters and to introduce the new characters. What they gave us was Rey, an over powered ""Jedi"" with no training who magically can pretty much do anything a experienced Jedi can. Finn, the winy character we have t learn to love because he's a main character. And Poe, probably the coolest one out of them all except how hard they make him to be like Han Solo. The only thing the new movies had going for them was the light saber battles."
"The long-awaited and anticipated return of the ""Star Wars"" saga has arrived with ""The Force Awakens"", an epic, dazzling, emotional and superbly acted start to a new beginning for the series. After the MOSTLY underwhelming prequel trilogy (with the exception of ""Revenge of the Sith""), director J.J. Abrams has taken the chair with a keen eye. They spent a massive 245 million dollars on this film, and every cent has fortunately paid off. The new characters (Rey, Finn, and Poe) are intriguing, and they also introduce a new villain (Kylo Ren), who is surprisingly developed. A nearly-perfect combination of new roles and nostalgia, this is something to be seen.

90/100"
"Y'all seen a new hope?"
"It's better then the last jedi, but after seeing this, along with many other very poor desicions disney has made with star wars, it's safe to say Disney doesn't really care about Star Wars fans."
"For the return to Star Wars that I was eager for, it fell kind of flat.  I wanted to know what happened in the last 30 years, and I wanted to see my childhood heroes at the forefront of the story again.  I like the new characters just fine, and I accept that you can't center an action adventure story on 60-year-olds.  But I wanted to be brought back into the setting with the familiar.  I also wanted it to not be a carbon copy of episode 4... which would include meaning that there isn't an Empire/First-Order that still in military control.  Why bother winning the war in Return of the Jedi?  If nothing is going to change, Return of the Jedi is pointless.  So, I think episode 7 failed at setting us up for the sequel trilogy and put us on a bad path for story that could have been amazing.  But it's still more enjoyable than episode 8."
"Loved this episode. Sequel trilogy remains to be a celebration of Star Wars. The Force Awakens claims to the sagas former glory, while at the same time builds on new characters (who are all amazing)! Not my favorite in the saga, but was my first time seeing a Star Wars film in a theatre. Will always hold a special place in my heart! ❤️ Godspeed, Rebels!"
"If you have seen a new hope then there is no point to watching this movie.  It is basically a shot for shot remake. The parts that are different are filled with lazy screen  writing and very poor choreography."
"Not only is The Force Awakens an inferior carbon copy of the original Star Wars, but its two sequels further ruin it retroactively.
J J Abrams is a hack who relies on cheap nostalgia and mysteries that not even he knows the answers to. 

No original characters are memorable. 
When Rey meets Han Solo, she one-ups him at fixing his own ship. Contrast that to when Luke meets Han Solo in the original Star Wars:

Luke: [shocked] Ten thousand!? We could almost buy our own ship for that!
Han: But who's gonna fly it, kid? You?

When Luke meets Princess Leia, she says, ""Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?"" Then she quips, ""This is some rescue."" 

In contrast, when Finn meets Rey, he is in love with her and tries to hold her hand, asking, ""You got a boyfriend—a cute boyfriend?""

When all other characters immediately like the main character, the audience cannot relate to her.

It almost feels as if a computer algorithm spat out the script. You could almost call it a Bad Robot. Ba dum tss."
"While obviously a soft reboot of the original trilogy, it is a good looking movie and it comes with the Star Wars bonus.
The weak story is good enough, if you don't think too much about it."
"This movie is to blame for every bad thing in the sequels, the first part of the trilogy is the most important because that one sets the stage, that one determines what happened during the 40 years of backstory. 
If we look at the prequels, we see that there was worldbuilding done there, the galaxy in the prequels is fundamentally different from the galaxy in the OT. You start with this world, and then you build a story that flows organically from the events in that world.

The prequels fundamentally showed a different status quo, instead of the Jedi being these hermits, we were in a different part of their history, here they were interwoven with politics, they were basically public servants. Instead of a empire ruled by a galactic dictator you had this horrible inefficient republic that had basically grown too bloated with politics and technicalities to function. These changes are clearly shown, we see life as it is throughout these movies, which helps us place and understand the characters in the world.

But the force awakens didn't do this. The galaxy in TFA is fundamentally the same as the one in the OT, which is absolutely disastrous since that tells us that the actions of our heroes of the OT didn't matter, it all becomes meaningless. If Luke has also become a random hermit, then all our fantasies about lukes life fall to pieces, his life was wasted. If the last order is around building death stars then none of it really mattered. 

Sure, it's somewhat stated that there is a new republic or something, but it gets blown up immediately, we don't see this new world and how it slowly falls apart, we are still just a bunch of rebels in space....none of it mattered. 

Compare this to the mandalorian, which is all about showing the galaxy living and reacting to the fall of the empire, it's 100% driven by worldbuilding and stage setting.

TFA took the most famous heroes, broke up the most famous couple, never showed the three on screen together (WTF!), and then killed one of the three to prevent anyone from fixing this mess. This is such a fundamentally poor decision that it boggles my mind, present this in film class and you'd get kicked from the university. Who in their right mind would take the most famous trio in movie history, one that people have been waiting to see together again for FORTY YEARS, and then NOT have them share a scene?...

It's been 40 years, Disney should have spend the necessary time to set up the world, show what Luke has done, create a new Jedi order that has learned from the past and stays away from politics, we should see Han and Leia be a family, we should see the fruits of their labors and cry as it all falls apart over the course of a three movies, and cheer at the slow passing of the torch to a new set of heroes. Instead, TFA skipped all that and went straight to the new heroes that no one cared about. And because we didn't take the time to acclimatize to the old heroes again there are no tears when they sacrifice themselves, and since the movies didn't take the time for us to get to know the new heroes we can't cheer for them when they become the heroes.

TFA killed star wars, it just took three movies to bleed out."
"It started out really good. And then Han and Leia spoke to each other and you really that ROTJ was not as happy as an ending as you thought. And that the substance of our beloved characters were sabotaged...what a terrible thing to do to Star Wars."
"Love Rey & Kylo. Acting is fantastic all around. Good story, good drama."
"I didn't really mind that the story was so symilar to episode IV. But they could have changed something, I guess... :S"
"A remake of A New Hope."
"Just a Disney made watered down version of the original Star Wars film."
"While surely a dazzling visual and technical adventure, the film sets up a series of questions just for the sake of mystery, without really having any answers for them. The story is frustratingly unoriginal, but introduces us to some very interesting and likeable characters, in addition to a compelling villain."
"dont believe this rotten tomatoes hack. This movie was a disappointment."
"Could have been worse..."
"Increadibly cinematic! Star Wars: The Force Awakins is an increadible step up from the original Star Wars films."
"Gosh, I really hope JJ has a coherent plot line and full character arc for all of these ideas he's pitching, otherwise we're going to end up with a mishmash of semi-recognizable events that make us say, ""Oh, yeah, I kind of remember that,"" but without actually creating anything new."
"repetitivo, confuso, sem nexo"
"So basically episode IV but in shitty?"
"A boring meh fest. Only rotten tomatoes rigged 86% unethical review system can save it. Help Me Rotten Tomatoes. You're my only hope...

Kylo Ren actor was bad... Pointless scenes.. A death scene which seemed as unenthusiastic and unemotional as a Blade runner voice over."
"Lazy movie, no risks were taken. Rey is overpowered. The movie is good entertainment though."
"MELHOR STAR WARS FOREVER"
"Star Wars: the Force Awakens is a great start for the newly begun(hmm, it's already been 4 years) Star Wars trilogy. I loved the action scenes, the CGI, and the amazing cast (Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are awesome, not to mention the return of Harrison Ford). There's so much to be excited about this movie if you ever thought that Star Wars movies were fun. The only disappointment: the lack of originality. I mean, eveything about the First Order and the Resistence seems somewhat similar to that of the Empire and the Rebellion. But who cares??? Force Awakens is really impressive and that's all that matters, for now."
"Made me hopeful about Star Wars in the hands of Disney.

Safe and uninspired, but competent."
"exhausting, boring, nonsensical and derivative. An insult to the audience."
"Remake of episode 1? they f..k the star wars universe, logic..don't care about the story, only about the propaganda. There are plenty of issues...It is not a science fiction movie but an action movie..."
"Measly additipn the star wars universe nowhere near as good as the new episode 9"
"Entertaining, faithful, nostalgic, with new empathetic protagonists and a plot that reminds us of the original trilogy but its lack of originality and similarities with Episode IV makes The Force Awakens a good start but not what was expected."
"It was a set up and a nostalgia trip - and I'm ok with that."
"I just LOVE this movie!"
"(Spoilers)
You have the chance of creating a brand new star wars trilogy and what do you do?
1) Give it a plot that is a rip-off of episode 6 which is a rip-of off episode 4;
2) Nullify episode's 6 ending
3) Create rip off characters
4) Do not explain the villain nor the main character's power.
Tis is the worst kind of movie that relies only on fan's nostalgia while bringing only recycled concepts."
"Boyega is a eunuch of a man, stripped not only of his masculinity but of all character and personality as well.  White men are are all space nazis.  And Rey is as powerful as Darth Sidious without training, facepalm.  This is a complete wreck."
"The Force Awakens was a nice transition from the original trilogy to this new Disney sequel trilogy. It was familiar enough to fans while introducing new faces to this Star Wars universe. The humor was good and the pacing as well. The issues with this movie are its rehashing of A New Hope, and probably too few original plot choices to really forge a path of its own. What is this new trilogy trying to say? The Force Awakens did lay down some nice threads for subsequent films to build on. This movie is worth a watch and the soundtrack is great too. It's not quite as amazing as the original trilogy and it doesn't have the emotion and excitement of Anakin vs Obi-Wan, but it has its moments."
"Not only is this the Best of the sequel trilogy (with The Rise Of Skywalker in a close second, and The Last Jedi not far behind in third [I love all the SW films]) it is possibly on of the best in the franchise! Love the characters, the style, the questions, the pacing, it was really well done!"
"A stellar movie that leans in on the nostalgia while still adding refreshing ideas to the mix. I found the story to be very interesting and the film was good at building upon the Star Wars lore. One of my only real complaints is that the characters are pretty standard, and Kylo Ren acts as a pretty weak villain. The cast can still hold up quite well though, due to the material being written fairly well."
"THE FARCE AWAKENS !!! 
We wait 32-33 years to see the Return of Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker and all we got was 6 seconds of screeen time & NO DIALOGUE. 👎👎👎👎
What a waste of a golden opportunity  😠"
"Excellent movie to start the sequel trilogy an introduce its new characters. Feels like Star Wars."
"Great start to the trilogy."
"Excellent production value. Good script, though a bit childish. Not a very original storyline considering the potential that this universe allows. Also, there is a great deal of legacy content with better more original writing."
"Better than the prequels. I guess. Nothing memorable about it. Not something I'd think to watch again in 2, 5, 10, 30 ye.. ever again."
"JJ Abrams breathes new life into this franchise by getting back to its roots of strong characters, fun adventure, and exciting action.  Despite sticking a bit too closely to the plot of the original Star Wars, Abrams and writer Lawrence Kasdan do enough to put a new spin on certain character tropes while keeping the film moving at a brisk enough pace to keep it engaging throughout."
"You know, star wars seems like such an easy franchise to win with. I've only seen the first two newest movies and they were aimless. It was fully obvious that they were making this up as they went along. They should have had a solid writer and paid him or her their weight in gold for a complete trilogy. It would have been great cinema. My problem with the the force awakens: Rae's character was underdeveloped and did not make the audience relate to her. Finn's character was underdeveloped and did not make the audience feel for him. Ren's character should have showed an ascension to power to lead the empire instead of already being in a power position. Rae's character could not have been as naturally skilled as she was with a light saber and instead should have been gifted in force power, surprising Ren somehow and escaping star killer base. Mas kanata, why? The other question about mas kanata, why why why? My problem with the second installment, the last jedi: everything. Mainly, I had an issue with the fact that Luke skywalker was not a G. Being a jedi for all of the years, luke should have been cutting war machines to pieces and force throwing stormtroopers through walls with ease. But what do we see as Luke skywalkers top skill? A force projection that cost him his life. It reminded me of the time Daffy duck wanted to show the best magic trick and blew himself up turning into a ghost to a thunderous round of applause, but instead of applause, exponentially more people let out a collective grown and wanted their money back. Even Mark Hamill admitted he read the script trying to see how Luke matured and wondered, ""who is this guy?"" In regards to Luke's character arc. Then there were other problems: The space chase? The battle on the salt plains? While george Lucas seemed to have some type of logic with the war settings in the first three films, this trilogy seemed to simply regard settings as cool looking places to film battles. After watching the Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, I knew I would not be paying for movie tickets for the third. I'll catch the latest installment on redbox."
"A lot of people criticize this movie for having a plot that's a near carbon copy of the original ""Star Wars""--But that's one of the things I like about it!  I thought this was a successful ""reboot"" of the SW franchise in that it felt more like the original trilogy than any of those crappy prequels.  (Man, those prequels suck!!!)  In my opinion, a familiar plot and a bunch of familiar--albeit much older--faces is exactly what was needed to rekindle the spark and get real SW fans excited again.  Believe it or not, after seeing this movie, I had brief hopes that the SW franchise was in good hands, and that Disney would be churning out great SW films for many years to come.  Alas, it was not meant to be as every SW film since ""The Force Awakens"" has been inferior, reaching absolute rock bottom with ""The Last Jedi"" which was a DELIBERATE slap in the face to SW fans everywhere.  (Rian Johnson is a complete idiot.)  It looks like ""The Force Awakens"" will live on forever as my fourth favorite SW movie after the original trilogy..."
"the movies premise: hey do you guys remember star wars?"
"Episode VII of Star Wars also happens to be the Seventh best Episode in the franchise. Go figure. All that $ and power at Disney, along with all the collaboration that went into this film, and the best they could come up with was swiping and retconning George Lucas' script for episode IV?!? Seriously?"
"Great start for the sequel trilogy! I really loved the nostalgic feeling and the awesome visual solutions"
"A mostly decent introduction of the new characters that plays it a bit too safe. It is well executed, and while it does have a lot of issues, it still ends up being an entertaining watch."
"Re-watch/Re-rate) First re-watch since my (bare-bones) original post in February to pregame Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and I must say, I enjoyed it even more than the first viewing. I thought Episode VII was a good blend of nostalgia-blasts and character development for the many new faces added to the franchise. We got more insight into the First Order, or the Neo-Empire, with Finn's defection, and how the Resistance (the Neo-Rebels) has managed to stay cohesive, fully expecting the dark-side to rise once again. Of course, I wanted more light-saber battles, but I admittedly have an insatiable thirst for light-saber battles, so no points lost there. My biggest gripe this viewing was Rey's constant questioning if they Jedi, and Luke Skywalker, were ever real. It didn't make sense considering Kylo Ren trained to be a Jedi with Skywalker, a man who pretty much everyone assumes is alive, but hidden. I understand despotic regimes rewrite the past (I've read ""1984""), but the Republic was very much in power during most of Rey's life, not the First Order, and the Star Wars Universe extends for galaxies, therefore making it unrealistic such a well-known figure would merely be wiped from history within one/two generations. Nevertheless, The Force Awakens is a fantastic start to the final trilogy of a beloved franchise."
"Only positive thing of that movie are special effects that got very advanced comparing to other movies.Movie has no story,some scenes are to long.You wait whole movie for some good action or star wars spirit but it doesnt come.Main character is played well though its really bad written.Main antagonist is really weak and new order brings no feelings at all comparing to old Empire.Some jokes are really bad and can be compared to Avengers as they dont suit here.Overal its action movie for one time."
"Amazing, i loved it."
"I did not like this film as I felt like it made little to no sense and was banking on nostalgia."
